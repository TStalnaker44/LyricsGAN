Yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I've been through mountains and seas\nTryna get you to come back to me\nAnd I've been far, and I've been so deep\nNow I find it harder and harder to breathe\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I need some new love\nNew love, new love\nAnd I need some new love\nNew love, new love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9ea5e88710780e16a411941db268fc8c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dua Lipa"}
