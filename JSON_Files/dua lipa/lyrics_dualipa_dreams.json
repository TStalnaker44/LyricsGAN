Let me know\n'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go\nAnd I know it's not real, but the way that I feel\nI just need to know\nCan I get it like that, that, that? Let me know\n'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go\nAnd I know it's not real, but the way that I feel\nI just need to know, know, know, know\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my dreams\nYou say you want me, my body\nIn my dreams\nYou say you need me, believe me\nIn my dreams\nYou say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams\nIn my dreams\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou love me like yeah\nYou love me right, oh yeah\nYou love me like yeah\nYou love me right, oh yeah\nYou love me like yeah\nYou love me right, oh yeah\nYou love me like, you love me right\nIn my dreams\n\n[Verse 2]\nInside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name\nIt's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me\n'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round\nTime is tickin', we gotta leave now\nTime is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight\nHey\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan I get it like that, that, that?
