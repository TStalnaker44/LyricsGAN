Next to you, next to you\n\n(Chorus)\nLet me be your Favorite Problem\nLet me be the one who\u2019s never forgotten\nLet me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl\nLet me be your Favorite Problem\nLet me be the one who\u2019s never forgotten\nLet me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl\n\n(Verse)\nI\u2019ll kiss all the ink on your neck, cause baby you do it and you do it the best\nLights off, let\u2019s get a little louder\nHold me for a little longer\nI love it when you whisper in my ear, telling me things I always wanna hear\nYou\u2019re the medicine, doctor\n[?] ,softer\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nMy heart\u2019s never wanted anything more than you yet, when I see all those tattoos all over your chest, I want nothing more than to wake in your bed.
