Yeah\nAs my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol\nWhere I'm coming from, yeah\nIt's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb\n\n[Chorus]\nCause we're hot like hell\nDoes it burn when I'm not there?\nWhen you're by yourself\nAm I the answer to your prayers?\nI'm giving you that pleasure heaven\nAnd I'll give it to you\nHotter than hell\nHotter than hell\nHotter than hell\n\n[Drop]\nI'm giving you that pleasure\nI'm giving you that pleasure heaven\nI'm giving you that pleasure\nAnd I'll give it to you\nHotter than hell\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're my manna from heaven\nWe all gotta get fed\nCan let me know I'm wanted\nCan let me in your head\nI'm not here to make you kneel\nBut it's praise that I'll get\nYou ain't gonna walk free boy\nNot finished with you yet, no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan you feel the warmth?
