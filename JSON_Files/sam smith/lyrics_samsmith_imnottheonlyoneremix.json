Ignore it or forefeit\n\n[Chorus: Sam Smith]\nYou say I'm crazy\nCause you don't think I know what you've done\nBut when you call me baby\nI know I'm not the only one\nI know I'm not the only one\nI know I'm not the only one\nAnd I know and I know and I know and I know and I know\nAnd I don't know\nI know I'm not the only one", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f36db43f01d342e0ede1beb63583f7c4.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sam Smith"}
