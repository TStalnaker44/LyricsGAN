You got me losing every breath\nWhat did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI feel we're close enough\nCould I lock in your love?\nI feel we\u2019re close enough\nCould I lock in your love?\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I\u2019ve got you in my space\nI won\u2019t let go of you\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI\u2019m latching on to you\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I\u2019ve got you in my space\nI won\u2019t let go of you\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI\u2019m latching on to you\n\nI\u2019m latching on to you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c95efde87d547b02763b0c7d515c1c1d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sam Smith"}
