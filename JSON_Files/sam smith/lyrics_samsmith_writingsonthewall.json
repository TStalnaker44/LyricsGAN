How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\n\n[Verse 2]\nA million shards of glass\nThat haunt me from my past\nAs the stars begin to gather\nAnd the light begins to fade\nWhen all hope begins to shatter\nKnow that I won't be afraid\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I risk it all\nCould you break my fall?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\n\n[Bridge]\nThe writing's on the wall\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/bf5c52d97920ac3614d7b0a2ee66a03c.634x634x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sam Smith"}
