Blige]\nWhy am I so emotional?\nThis is not a good look, gain some self control\nAnd deep down I know this never works\nBut you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nOh won't you stay with me?\nCause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\nOh won't you stay with me?\n\n[Chorus: Sam Smith]\nOh won't you stay with me?\nCause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\nBut darling, stay with me\n\n[Chorus: Sam Smith & (Mary J. Blige)]\nOh won't you stay with me?\n(Won't you stay? Won't you stay?)\nCause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\n(This ain't love, no, no, no)\nBut darling, stay with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f88112e46f988f2e2ec76c5d0d35ebf8.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sam Smith"}
