(Who's to say you won't hear me?)\nThis hurt that I've been through\nI'm missing you, missing you like crazy\n\nYou told me not to cry when you were gone\nBut the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nAnd I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight\n\nLay me down tonight, lay me by your side\nLay me down tonight, lay me by your side\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nAnd I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c9ce9032f369d402e814251982a1fe41.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sam Smith"}
