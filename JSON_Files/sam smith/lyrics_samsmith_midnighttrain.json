What will your family think of me?\nThey brought me in, they helped me out with everything\nBut I give a little piece of me away\nEvery single day\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train\nI got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain\nI'll always love you\nBut tonight's the night I choose to walk away\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove you so much that I have to let you go\nI'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know\nBut it would be wrong for me to stay\nAnd I'll just give you hope\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train\nI got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain\nI'll always love you\nBut tonight's the night I choose to walk away\nI can't stop cryin', I hate that I've caused you pain\nBut I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same\nI'll always love you\nBut tonight's the night I choose to walk away\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\nSo I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train\nI got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain\nI'll always love you\nBut tonight's the night I choose to walk away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28874f305fb0e34ec0bc7333cfc2e12e.910x910x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sam Smith"}
