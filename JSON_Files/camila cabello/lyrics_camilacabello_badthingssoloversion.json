Am I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I liked\nDon't think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say? It\u2019s complicated\nDon't matter what you say, don't matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good that you can\u2019t explain it\nWhat can I say? It's complicated\n\n[Verse 1]\nNothing is that bad if it feels good\nSo you come back like I knew you would\nAnd we're both wild and the night's young\nAnd you're my drug, breathe you into my face numb\nDrop it down to that bass drum\nI got what you dream about\nNails scratching my back tatt\nEyes closed while you scream out\nAnd you keep me in with those hips\nWhile my teeth sink in those lips\nWhile your body's giving me life\nAnd you suffocate in my kiss\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI want you forever even when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can take you wherever, like\nI want you forever even when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can look at you whenever, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAm I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I liked\nDon\u2019t think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say? It\u2019s complicated\nDon't matter what you say, don\u2019t matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good that you can't explain it\nWhat can I say? It's complicated\n\n[Bridge]\nThe way we love is so unique\nAnd when we touch, I'm shivering\nAnd no one has to get it, just you and me\nCause we\u2019re just living between the sheets\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI want you forever even when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can take you wherever, like\nI want you forever even when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can look at you whenever, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAm I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I liked\nDon't think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say? It's complicated\nDon't matter what you say, don't matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good that you can't explain it\nWhat can I say?
