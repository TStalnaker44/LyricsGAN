Give me a reason why\nI thought that I could trust you, never mind\nWhy all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?\nI guess I'm too naive to read the signs\n\n[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nAll they ever do is let me down\nEvery time I let somebody in\nThen I find out what they're all about\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nWonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nGotta get up out of this town\n\n[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello]\nOh, ohhh\nOhhh, ah\n\n[Verse 2: Swae Lee]\nTrust slow for a reason (reason)\nSee through the fake pretty easy (yeah!)\nStayin' down 'till the world ends (easy)\nGuilt trips on the weekend (hey)\nI pack more than suits in my suitcases (yeah)\nAll this cash, that's friendly faces\nBeen movin' fast, I'm racin' (wait)\nGet up, you're going places (c'mon)\nEvery day, tryna maintain\nSame old me, ain't a damn thing change (change)\nReal friends screaming, \"Gang, gang, gang\"\n\n[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nAll they ever do is let me down (oh-no-no)\nEvery time I let somebody in (woah)\nThen I find out what they're all about (all about, ooh)\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nWonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nGotta get up out of this town\n\n[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]\nReal friends\nOh, ohhh\nLookin' for some real friends\nReal friends\nYeah!\n\n[Bridge: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]\nI just wanna talk about nothin'\nWith somebody that means something (conversation)\nSpell the names of all our dreams and demons\nFor the times that I don't understand (why?)\nTell me what's the point of a moon like this\nWhen I'm alone again (yeah yeah yeah)\nCan I run away to somewhere beautiful\nWhere nobody knows my name?\n\n[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\nAll they ever do is let me down\nAnd I let somebody in\nBut I find out what they're all about\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nAll they ever do is let me down\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)\nGotta get up out of this town, yeah\n\n[Outro: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]\nSpend a fortune with my real friends\nGood gas, what we breathe in (oh, ohhh)\nPop corks with some real friends\nKillin' the scene, yeah (ohhh, ah)\nHangin' with my real friends\nThat I surround myself with (ohhh, ah)\nYou have to have my back (ah)\nLookin' like my real friends", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9ea4b164836a53a1168cce853ce177e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Camila Cabello"}
