(I, I)\nShow me the scary parts (I, I)\nWho are you when it\u2019s 3AM and you're all alone\nAnd L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)\nWho are you in the dark?\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlus one, guest list\nBut you don't even know what her name is\nSecrets, endless\nI know that you feel me\n\n[Refrain]\nYou\u2019re runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' (oh)\nMaking the rounds with all your fake friends (making)\nRunnin', runnin' away from it (away)\nYou can strip down without showing skin, now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I can see you're scared of your emotions\nI can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless\nSo why can't you show me?\nWhy can't you show me?\nI can see you're looking for distractions\nI can see you're tired of the acting\nSo why can't you show me?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho are you in the dark? (I, I)\nShow me the scary parts (I, I)\nWho are you when it's 3AM and you're all alone\nAnd L.A. doesn't feel like home?

(I, I)\nShow me the scary parts (I, I)\nWho are you when it's 3 AM\nAnd you're all alone (and you're all alone)\nAnd L.A. doesn't feel like home? (No, I, I, I)\nWho are you in the dark?\n\n[Outro]\nMmmmm, mmmm, mmm\nWho are you in the dark?\nMmmmm, mmmm, mmm\nWho are you in the dark?\nMmmmm, mmmm, mmm\nWho are you in the dark?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6734d5f2d0c973dce60943e2a00a7713.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Camila Cabello"}
