How you've been?\nLately I wonder how it feels to steal your kiss\nNothing much, just fine I'm doing well\nAnd you can read between the lines but God, I fell\n\n[Chorus]\nI only told the moon, tonight up on the roof\nI told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you\nI only told the moon, about the way you move\nI asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too\n\n[Verse 2]\nSilence. Too loud. Say it, not now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo how are you? How you've been?\nLately I wonder how it feels to taste your lips\nNothing much, just fine I'm doing well\nAnd you can read between the lines but God, I fell\n\n[Chorus]\nI only told the moon, tonight up on the roof\nI told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you\nI only told the moon, about the way you move\nI asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too\nThat I give it all to you, I give it all to you, I give it all to you\nI only told the moon\n\n[Bridge]\nAh-ah-ah-ah\nAnd another love song will play on the radio, you know\nAh-ah-ah-ah\nOh, and I\u2019ll wait for the moon to lean in close and say\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nThat he only told the moon, tonight up on the roof\nHe told me that he\u2019s scared that all his thoughts they look like you\nI only told the moon, about the way you move\nI asked her to please tell me if you tell this to her too\n\n[Outro]\nThat I give it all to you, I give it all to you, I give it all to you\nWe only told the moon\nWe only told the moon\nOnly told the moon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c74b97a034e030eb675599b1930c75fc.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Camila Cabello"}
