(no)\nIf the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon\nIf you fall when the clock hits the spot then\nBibbidi-bobbiidi-boo\nInstagram that just won't do\nBack then I managed the crew\nAt twelve it's just me in my ripped skinny jeans\nBut I'm still a damn princess to you\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah\nBibbidi-bobbiidi-boo\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah\nBibbidi-bobbiidi-boo\n\n[Verse 2]\nI broke a sweat tryna catch you single blame from it\nBut you're not listening, oh, you want kissing\nI'm not asking for your red wine\nBut couldn't have you hold me down\n\nI mean is this supposed to be like a date or something?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nCinderella never asked for a prince, (no)\nJust a dress, there anybody like this? (no)\nIf the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon\nIf you fall when the clock hits the spot then\nBibbidi-bobbiidi-boo\nCinderella never asked for a prince, (no)\nJust a dress, there anybody like this? (no)\nUs twenty first century girls need chivalry too\nIf you fall when the clock hits the spot then\nBibbidi-bobbiidi-boo\n\n[Bridge]\nOnce upon a time there was a boy with a face divine\nBut he couldn't understand how to be a gentleman\nAnd so the lady said farewell, she deserved better for real\nAnd now he's crying alone\nCause she sassed him with this song, oh\n\n[Chorus 3]\nCinderella never asked for a prince, (no)\nJust a dress, there anybody like this? (no)\nIf the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon\nIf you fall when the clock hits the spot then\nIf you fall when the clock hits the spot then\n\n[Outro]\nMhm, I'm still a damn princess to you\nBibbidi-bobbiidi-boo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb934f639695f34736e7788c8591d872.850x850x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Camila Cabello"}
