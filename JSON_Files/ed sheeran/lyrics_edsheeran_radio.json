What's going on there?\nTo tell you the truth, I don't really care\nI am my music, my music is me\nLike it or not, this is how it's gonna be\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI never had a playlist in my heart\nNow I need an A list just to chart\nBut I've been famous from the start\nHow am I gonna make my mark?\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & (Jme)]\nAre you gonna play me though?\nThis song was never meant for the radio\n(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing\nAnd I don't have time for a playlist)\nHow much will you pay me though\nIf this song's not a hit on the radio?\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]\nI feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial\nBleeding through the speakers, written by the pile\nSo won't you hear me out?\nNever feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club\nMaybe I could take time singing for the dub\nSo won't you hear me out?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI never had a playlist in my heart\nNow I need an A list just to chart\nBut I've been famous from the start\nHow am I gonna make my mark?\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & (Jme)]\nAre you gonna play me though?\nThis song was never meant for the radio\n(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing\nAnd I don't have time for a playlist)\nHow much will you pay me though\nIf this song's not a hit on the radio?\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nAre you gonna play me though?\nThis song was never meant for the radio\n(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing\nAnd I don't have time for a playlist)\nHow much will you pay me though\nIf this song's not a hit on the radio?\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97b67ed332a10b7e1dab779c744bdf50.300x292x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
