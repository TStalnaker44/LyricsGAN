(and I feel love)\nFor how long long I love my lover? (feel it all over now now and I feel love)\nFor how long long I love my lover, now, now\n(feel it all over now now and I feel love)\nFor how long long I love my lover, now, now\n(feel it all over now now and I feel love)\nFor how long long I love my lover, now, now\n(feel it all over now now and I feel love)\nFor how long long I love my lover, now, now\n(feel it all over now now and I feel love)\nFor how long I love my lover, now, now?\nFor how long long I love my lover?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36b79bdfcd745feefb97bf07d12aed55.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
