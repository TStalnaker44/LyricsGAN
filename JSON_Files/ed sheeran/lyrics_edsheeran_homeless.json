Everything's such a blur\nIt's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt\nOn a late night, coming home from way too many train rides\nLace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time\nHighbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI haven't slept for the past week\nTwo hours ain't enough for me\nI feel inspired, at quarter to three am\nI haven't changed since our last meet\nI'm still getting all my meals for free\nI think I'm being shunned by my feet again\n\n[Hook]\nIt's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nIt's not a homeless life for me, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my Ipod\nFeeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up\nDriver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on\nSong plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong\nTruth be, never went to UNI\nPeople see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see\nI'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done\nEverything I need to except get a 2:1\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI haven't slept for the past week\nTwo hours ain't enough for me\nI feel inspired, at quarter to three am\nI haven't changed since our last meet\nI'm still getting all my meals for free\nI think I'm being shunned by my feet again\n\n[Hook]\nIt's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me yeah...\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen I feel cold\nYou keep me warm\nAnd I'm not looking for some loose change\nJust wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet\n\n[Hook]\nIt's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\n\n[Hook]\nIt's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nAnd it's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\nIt's not a homeless life for me, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c5e284a904168073ca2da065d3a5652.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
