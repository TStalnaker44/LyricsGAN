Keep it between friends?\nThough I know you'll never love me, like you used to\nThere may be other people like us\nWill see the flicker of the clipper when they light up\nFlames just create us, burns don't heal like before\nYou don't hold me anymore\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nOn cold days, cold plays out like the band's name\nI know I can't heal things with a handshake\nYou know I can't change, as I began saying\nYou cut me wide open like a landscape\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\nTo applaud you with the sound that my hands make\nShould I? Should I?\n\n[Chorus]\nMaybe I'll get drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love\n\n[Bridge]\nAll by myself\nI'm here again\nAll by myself\nYou know I'll never change\nAll by myself\nAll by myself\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/07ac4bacf508642bcfbcd8aa35cdfaa3.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
