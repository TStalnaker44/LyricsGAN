know\nYou'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in\nI never want to get bitten\n'Cause plagiarism is hidden\nWatch how I sit on the rhythm\nPrisoner with a vision\nSigns of a label\nBut didn't listen to any criticism\nThought you knew but you didn't\nSo perk your ears up and listen\nStudio is a system\nAnd you could say that I'm driven\nAnd now it's onto the next saga\nWe drink the best lager\nI'll never try to win you over like your stepfather\nI do my own thing now\nAnd get respect after\nAnd I'm avoiding the 'caine\nLike it was Get Carter\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\nBut it's safe to say that it kept me grounded\nLike a paper weight\nAt 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked\nWent from sleeping at a subway station\nTo sleeping with a movie star\nAnd adding to the population\nNot my imagination\nI don't wanna relax\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?\nI take it back now\n\nMmmm come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack I'll be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black\nWhen I bring it to school\nI make a beat with my feet\nBy just hittin' the loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove\nThat I can fit in these shoes\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene\nLike an opal fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering everything that happens\nIs from now on\nI'll be ready to start again\nBy the end of the song\nThis is like claiming I handled it wrong\nBut then I've never had an enemy\nExcept the NME but I'll be selling\nTwice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me\nAnd festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses rubber dingied rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nI'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it\nThis song's from the heart cover the planet\nI take it back now\n\nMmmm come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nAnd take it back now\n\nNow I don't ever wanna be perfect\n'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\n'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly need to let my liver be\nAnd I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends\nIs good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\n'Cause that's how it's supposed to be\nI'm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams\nBut, but I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\nBut more likely\nYou find me\nIn the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid\nDiscussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing\nThat we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised\nRemembering our background\nSat down\nThat's how we plan it out\nIt's time to take it back now\n\nMmmm come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\nMmm come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\nWritten in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype\nAm I just living the lie\nWith this you must know that the number's just sold whoa\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago\nI couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me buskin' on the street\nWhen it was cold outdoors\nAnd now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\nNever to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and\nMost of these other guys are kids that Pulses\nLittle sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\nDreams you own, just set your goals\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\nYou'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff6b6189e1a78e497e09c90c1f6692e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
