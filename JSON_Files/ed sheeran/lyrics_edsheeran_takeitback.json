{"songs": [{"title": "Take It Back", "album": "\u00d7 (Multiply)", "year": "2014-06-20", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow\nI've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know\nYou'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in\nI never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden\nWatch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision\nSigned to a label but didn't listen to any criticism\nThought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen\nStudio is a system and you could say that I'm driven\nAnd now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager\nI'll never try to win you over like your stepfather\nI'll do my own thing now and get respect after\nAnd I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\nBut it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\nAt 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked\nAnd went from sleeping at a subway station\nTo sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\nNot my imagination, I don't wanna relax\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now\n\n[Hook]\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\n[Verse 2]\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack, I'll be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school\nI'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes\nI'll give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering, \"Everything that happens is from now on\"\nI'll be ready to start again by the end of the song\nAnd still they're claiming that I handle it wrong\nBut then I've never had an enemy except the NME\nBut I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nI'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it\nThis song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now\n\n[Hook]\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo, I'll take it back now\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, I don't ever wanna be perfect\n'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change, thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\n'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly, need to let my liver be\nAnd I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends\nIt's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\n'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but\nBut I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely\nYou'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down\nThat's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now\n\n[Hook]\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\n[Verse 4]\nMy dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme\nTill I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?\nWith this you must know that the numbers just sold\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 percent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 percent, it never fades\nDreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads\nTried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade\nOh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors\nNow I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss\nAnd most of these other guys are kids that pose\nHis little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\nDreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it\nTread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower\nYou'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow\nIgh!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36b79bdfcd745feefb97bf07d12aed55.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
