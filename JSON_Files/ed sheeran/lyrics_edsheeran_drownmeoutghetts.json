Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking?\nI'm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean\nBut I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining\nPlain sailing, no commotion\nLike a dolphin, when it's in motion\nBut i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken\nNo real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion\nFuck em all, this ain't no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side\nBut I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign\nThen I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye\nNah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive\n\nOoo, you can drag me in the deep ends\nOoo, but you won't ever drown me out\nOoo, you can drag me in the deep ends\nOoo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out\nYou won't drown me out\nYou won't drown me out\n\nOoo, you can drag me in the deep ends\nOoo, but you won't ever drown me out\nOoo, you can drag me in the deep ends\nOoo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out\nYou won't drown me out\nYou won't drown me out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff6b6189e1a78e497e09c90c1f6692e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
