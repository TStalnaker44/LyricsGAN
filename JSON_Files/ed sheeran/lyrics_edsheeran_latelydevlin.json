{"songs": [{"title": "Lately - devlin", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be\nAwaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees\nAdmiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe\nJet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep\nAlthough my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any\nClock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many\nAlthough my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon\nCos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true\nWe make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths\nTo see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves\n\nI say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme\nSo i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine\nCos we all recognise, real is what my father says\nAnd i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away\nOverworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow\nBut i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close\n\nDEVLIN\n5 o'clock with lights off\nInterview with a vampire\nSleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require\nI swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead\nWhos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z\nOver tired, pale faced like Michael Myers\nBags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired\nAnd over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying\nCuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game\nIts time to wage war\nScissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives\n2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight\nI'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line\nVillans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes\nBe wide awake just like your snorting lines\nOr get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by\n\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh\nThe times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be\n\nThe times i'm living in lately\n\nI brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth\nAnd the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out\nDeliver the raps how I flow\nI live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong\nBut they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded\nBe within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in\nIts all to do with timing not the label that you sign with\nThen my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in\nI try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows\nSome of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone\nIm still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow\nOpposite of sober cos I never did my homework\nWhich has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older\nI played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie\nI wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!\nNever die\n\nDEVLIN\n2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge\nMaking metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes\nAnd if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze\nTimes elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move\nWe scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do\nDriven young gentlemen\nI've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!\nIm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em\nWe got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em\nIn the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment\nFighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got\nI keep my pupils engaged\nLike a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake\n\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh\nThe times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4\nThe times i'm living in lately", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff6b6189e1a78e497e09c90c1f6692e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
