It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just wanted to say a couple more things: just remember that we are filming this for a DVD that you guys are going to be able to buy and tonight is being recorded for a live EP that you guys will also be able to buy so... I think we'd all agree that we're all a part of something really special because we're going to be able to take tonight home in a few weeks (cheering) So yeah, big honor for us all to be here and... I just want to personally say a big thank-you to Ed for asking me to um-- host tonight because it's just amazing and I think he's fantastic and I feel honored to be here. So that's it! It's time to welcome the fantastic Ed Sheeran to the stage. Make some noise!\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhite lips, pale face\nBreathing in the snowflakes\nBurnt lungs, sour taste\nLight's gone, day's end\nStruggling to pay rent\nLong nights, strange men\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd they say\nShe's in the Class A Team\nStuck in her daydream\nBeen this way since 18\nBut lately, her face seems\nSlowly sinking, wasting\nCrumbling like pastries\nAnd they scream\nThe worst things in life come free to us\n\n[Chorus 1]\nCause she's just under the upper hand\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\nAnd she don't want to go outside tonight\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\nOr sells love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nAngels to fly\n\n[Verse 2]\nRipped gloves, raincoat\nTried to swim and stay afloat\nDry house, wet clothes\nLoose change, bank notes\nWeary-eyed, dry throat\nCall girl, no phone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd they say\nShe's in the Class A Team\nStuck in her daydream\nBeen this way since 18\nBut lately, her face seems\nSlowly sinking, wasting\nCrumbling like pastries\nAnd they scream\nThe worst things in life come free to us\n\n[Chorus 1]\nCause she's just under the upper hand\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\nAnd she don't want to go outside tonight\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\nOr sells love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\n\n[Bridge]\nAn angel will die\nCovered in white\nClosed eyes and hoping for a better life\nThis time, we'll fade out tonight\nStraight down the line\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd they say\nShe's in the Class A Team\nStuck in her daydream\nBeen this way since 18\nBut lately, her face seems\nSlowly sinking, wasting\nCrumbling like pastries\nAnd they scream\nThe worst things in life come free to us\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\nAnd we don't want to go outside tonight\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\nOr sells love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nAngels to fly\nFly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo fly, to fly\nFor angels to die", "image": "https://images.genius.com/301f6bdd0968cba37fcf18de23b60240.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
