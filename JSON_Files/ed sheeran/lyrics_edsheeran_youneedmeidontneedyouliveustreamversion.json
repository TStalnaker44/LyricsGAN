break it down, thinking of making a new sound\nPlaying a different show every night in front of a new crowd\nThat\u2019s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now\nSee me lose focus as I sing to you loud\nI can\u2019t, no, I won\u2019t hush\nI\u2019ll say the words that make you blush\nI\u2019m gonna sing this now\nSee, I\u2019m true, my songs are where my heart is\nI'm like glue I stick to other artists\nI'm not you, now that would be disastrous\nLet me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures\nSee, I\u2019m real, I do it all, it\u2019s all me\nI\u2019m not fake, don\u2019t ever call me lazy\nI won\u2019t stay put, give me the chance to be free\nSuffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me\n\n[Chorus 1]\n'Cause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell\nDon't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell\nCall yourself a singer-writer, you\u2019re just bluffing\nName\u2019s on the credits and you didn\u2019t write nothing\nI sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool\nI will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School\nI came fast with the way I act, right\nI can\u2019t last, if I\u2019m smoking on a crack pipe\nAnd I won\u2019t be a product of my genre\nMy mind will always be stronger than my songs are\nNever believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya\nAlways read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia\nAnd musically I\u2019m demonstrating\nWhen I perform live, feels like I am meditating\nTimes at the enterprise when some fella filmed me\nA young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi\n\n[Chorus 1]\n'Cause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd all I want in this cold world is to make music and use it\nNot to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music\nWho did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?\nChitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me\nAll I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely\nTo be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?\nHey, so I keep singing that\nWhen I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters\nBecame invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar\nAnd made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark\nAnd then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody\nHennessey shots and... all these fools on the block\nWho said you gotta be a gangster now to raise the top?\nJust a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy\nWith my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die\nSo see the signs, stand to the side\nOpen your eyes and take a look and realise\nThe resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears\nI arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, A lone star\nUrban Angel rising from the ashes, surprising all haters\nGuiding, now moving steady when we say\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAyy, ayy, we bring the stars out\nWe bring the women and the cars and the cards out\nLet's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out\nAnd we can do this until we pass out, pass out\nYeah, we bring the stars out\nWe bring the women and the cars and the cards out\nLet's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out\nAnd we can do this until we pass out\n\n[Chorus/Collision]\n'Cause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man\n\n[Bridge]\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning\nI've been burning\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning\nI've been burning\nMy eyes are red I've been burning\nI've been burning on a spliff off your high grade\nMy eyes are red I've been burning\nI've been burning, burning, burning\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow where I come from burning weed it is a habit\nA big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it\n'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic\n'Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit\nYup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood\nOne of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should\nOne of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good\nBurning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel\nBut me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug\nAnd if I start to smoke it I'ma-nna turn into a thug\nWhere I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged\nWhere I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub\nWhere I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine\nI blaze high grade weed all the time\n\n[Chorus 2]\nNow my eyes are red\n'Cause you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nAnd you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 5]\n'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right\nI won't stop until my name's in lights\nAt stadium heights, with Damian Rice\nOn red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights\nBecause I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height and I gone hyper\nNever be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah\nThe game's over but now I'm on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track without a loop pedal\nPeople think that I'm bound to blow up\nI've done around about a thousand shows but\nI haven't got a house plus I live on a couch\nSo you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out\nWow, from day one I've been prepared\nWith V05 wax for my ginger hair\nNow I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of\nWhat the future holds cause it's another day\nPlus\nI'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic\nAnd I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nSlipping into another rapper shoes using new laces\nI'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the moustache\nI hit back, when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though\nAccording to the MySpace and YouTube videos\nI'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio\nMelody music maker, reading all the papers\nThey say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator", "image":
