I introduce myself. My name is Ed Sheeran and it's a pleasure to be here. Who's up for singing a bit, yeah? The lyrics are \"It's not a homeless life for me / It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\" That's a little bit of a sing-song right now\n\n[Outro]\nIt's not a homeless life for me\nIt's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\n\nThank you!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/301f6bdd0968cba37fcf18de23b60240.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
