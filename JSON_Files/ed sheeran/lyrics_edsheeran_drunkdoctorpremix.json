Keep it between friends?\nThough I know you'll never love me, like you used to\nThere may be other people like us\nWill see the flicker of the clipper when they light up\nFlames just create us, burns don't heal like before\nYou don't hold me anymore\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk\nI wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk\n\n[Breakdown]\nDrunk, drunk, drunk\nDrunk, drunk, drunk\nDrunk, drunk, drunk\nDrunk, drunk, drunk\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn cold days cold plays out like the band's name\nI know I can't heal things with a handshake\nYou know I can't change, as I began saying\nYou cut me wide open like a landscape\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\nTo applaud you with the sound that my hands make\nShould I? Should I?\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I'll get drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nMaybe I'll get drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/07ac4bacf508642bcfbcd8aa35cdfaa3.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
