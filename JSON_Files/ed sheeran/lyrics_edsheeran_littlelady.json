I wanna know\"\nNo prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nThere's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped\nAnd all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her 13th birthday\n\n[Chorus 2: Ed Sheeran]\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd go mad for a couple grams\nAnd we don't wanna go outside, tonight\nCause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and\nSell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nFly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo fly, to fly\nAngels to die", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97b67ed332a10b7e1dab779c744bdf50.300x292x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
