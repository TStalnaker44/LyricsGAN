Tell me if that\u2019s alright\nI don\u2019t wanna be here, I\u2019m not the sofa type\nTell me if you have a toothbrush you don\u2019t mind sharing\nShe said I wanna take off what you\u2019re wearing\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Bridge]\nShe\u2019s like the fast food, I\u2019ll regret it after\nAnd I needed money but I\u2019m too shy to ask her\nBut she buys me chips and cheese\nSo I tell her that she\u2019s all I need\n\n[Hook 2]\nTell her that I, tell her that I\nTell her that she\u2019s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\nAll I wanna do is be near\nTell her that I, tell her that I\nTell her that she\u2019s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that I love her more than anyone else\nIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell her myself\n\n[Hook 1]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28925f055d97f6d86e25c4bcce427f8a.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
