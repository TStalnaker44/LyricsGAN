a new sound\nPlaying a different show every night\nIn front of a new crowd\nThat's you now, ciao\nSeems that life is great now\nSee me lose focus as I sing to you loud\nI can't, no I won't hush\nI'll say the words that make you blush\nI'm gonna sing this now\nSee, I'm true\nMy songs are where my heart is\nI'm like glue\nI stick to other artists\nI'm not you\nNo, that would be disastrous\nLet me sing and do my thing\nAnd move to greener pastures\nSee, I'm real, I do it all, It's all me\nI'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy\nI won't stay put\nGive me the chance to be free\nSuffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me\nHey\n\n[Chorus]\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sing, I write my own tunes\nAnd I write my own verse, hell\nDon't need another wordsmith\nTo make my tune sell\nCall yourself a singer writer\nYou're just bluffing\nName's on the credits\nAnd you didn't write nothing\nI sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool\nI will blast and I didn't go to Brit school\nI came fast with the way I act right\nI can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe\nAnd I won't be a product of my genre\nMy mind will always be stronger than my songs are\nNever believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya\nAlways read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia\nAnd musically I'm demonstrating\nWhen I perform live feels like I am meditating\nTimes at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me\nYoung singer/writer like a Gabriella Cilmi\n\n[Chorus]\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\n[Bridge]\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning out\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning\nI've been burning on a spliff of your high-grade\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning\nI've been burning burning burning\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow, where I come burning weed it is a habit\nA big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it\nCause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic\nCause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit\nYeah do da burn up the place up in the hood\nOne of the things that I've inherited\nLike a ghetto man you should\nOne of the things is smoking weed\nYes it makes me feel good\nBut high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel\nMommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug\nAnd If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug\nWhere I come from all that talking\nIt could only get you mugged\nWhere I come from burning weed\nIt is a blessing from above\nWhere I come from, yes we burn it\nWhen we listen rob a dove\nWhere I come from, yes we burn it\nAfter we dash to make love\nWhere I come from, yes we burn it\nWhen the sun does shine\nI blaze high-grade weed all the time\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, my eyes are red\nCause you need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, my eyes are red\nCause you need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, my eyes are red\nCause you need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, my eyes are red\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, my eyes are red\nEyes are red\nOoohh\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\nEyes are red\n\nWoah\nWoah\nWoah\nWoah\nWoah\nYeah\n\n[Verse 5]\nCause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right\nI won't stop till my name's in lights\nAt stadium heights, with Damien Rice\nOn red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights\nBecause I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper\nNever be anything but a singer/songwriter\nYeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal\nPeople think that I'm bound to blow up\nI've done around about a thousand shows, but\nI haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch\nSo, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow\nFrom day one I've been prepared\nWith VO5 wax for my ginger hair\nSo now I'm back to the sofa\nGiving a dose of what the future holds-\nCos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr\nI've still got a rucksack for the old clothes\nI rap with the cold flows\nI'm back with the most jokes\nIn fact, you don't know\nOn tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant\nIf you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate\nMan, flows developing\nSkin lacks the melanin\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\nI do it for the hell of it\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team\nI seem to sell a bit\nI took what held me back with the women\nAnd then I packaged the image\nPut in some content\nAnd then I throw it back as a gimmick\nThe fact is this\nI'll end up dating actresses\nWake up on dirty mattresses\nI think I need to practice this\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\nWorld's on my shoulders\nI don't even know what Atlas is\nHard part's sharp like a cactus is\nI'm back to rapping back to back\nCause I've been practising\nI'm back to sing this, yes\n\n[Chorus]\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man\n\n[Verse 6]\nI'll keep my last name forever\nKeep this genre pretty basic\nGonna be breaking into other people's tune\nWhen I chase it\nAnd replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift\nInto another rapper's shoes, using new laces\nI'm selling CD's from my rucksack\nAiming for the papers\nSelling CD's from my rucksack\nAiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack\nStill had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the moustache\nI hit back when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago\nBut, more people hear me, though\nAccording to the Myspace and Youtube videos\nI'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio\nMelody music maker\nReading all the papers\nThey say I'm up and coming\nLike I'm fucking in an elevator\n\n[Chorus]\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you", "image":
