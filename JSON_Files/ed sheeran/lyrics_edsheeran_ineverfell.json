Wear Cape. Fly Show\nI could have taken anyone there\nBut I like the way she brushed her hair back\nI never trust, begin to realize\nHow fast I would turn an eye\nI was blind to all, yeah I saw all\n\n[Hook 1 x2]\n\n[Break]\nSeeing this fake heart break\nAnd stomach ache has got me\nActing like a pregnancy\n\n[Hook 2]\nI never fell for you, you tripped me\nCause even in my mind, in my mind\nI never fell for you, you tripped me\nIn my mind it's true, in my mind now\nI never fell for you, you tripped me\nEven in my mind, in my mind\nI never fell for you, you tripped me\nIn my mind now, my mind\nI never fell for you, you tripped me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff6b6189e1a78e497e09c90c1f6692e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
