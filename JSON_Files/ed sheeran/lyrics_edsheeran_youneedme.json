Hell\nDon't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?\nCall yourself a singer-writer\nYou're just bluffing\nYour name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing\nI sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool\nI will blast and I didn't go to Brit School\nI came fast with the way I act, right\nI can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe\n\nAnd I won't be a product of my genre\nMy mind will always be stronger than my songs are\nNever believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya\nAlways read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia\nAnd musically I'm demonstrating\nWhen I perform live, feels like I am meditating\nTimes at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me\n\"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi\"\n\n'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me\n\nCause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right\nI won't stop till my name's in light\nAt Stadium Heights with Damien Rice\nOn red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights\nBecause I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper\nNever be anything but a singer-songwriter\nThe games over but now I'm on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track without a loop pedal\n\nPeople think that I'm bound to blow up\nI've done around about a thousand shows\nBut I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch\nSo you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out\nWow\n\nFrom day one, I've been prepared\nWith vo5 wax for my ginger hair\nSo now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds\nCause it's another day\nPlus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic\n\nGonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nInto another rappers shoes using new laces\nSelling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the mustache\nI hit back when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago\nBut more people hear me though\nAccording to the Myspace and YouTube videos\nI'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio\nMelody music maker\nReading all the papers\nThey say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator\n\nCause you need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\n\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don't need you, at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff6b6189e1a78e497e09c90c1f6692e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ed Sheeran"}
