Can I get a what now?\nI swear I'll do, anything that I have to\nTill I forget about[?]\n\n[Chorus]\nJump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now\nDon't care, my head's spinning all around now\nI swear I'll do, anything that I have to[?]\nTill I forget about you!\nTill I forget about you!\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd you thought, I'd be here on my own\nWaiting for you to knock on my door\nSince you left I don't wait by the phone\nI'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving\nFound a place where I can lose myself\nAnd just leave your memory on the shelf\nSee I'm fine, no I don't need nobody else\nCause I'm, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going\nSome on sing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nSpending money like you don't mean a think\nGoing crazy, now don't even think\nI'm losing my mind, It's all I can do\nTil I forget about you\nLet\u00b4s go\nHow high can you sing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nTill I forget about you\nTill I forget about you\nI can't forget about you!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ed20fea6a648b60134d86d3306b98a6.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "Big Time Rush"}
