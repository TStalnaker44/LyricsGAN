What can I say?\nShe's beautiful, unusual, the prettiest thing in the room\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo one else compares to you\nJust do what you do and I will be there for you\nIf you take my hand (my hand), just give me the chance (the chance)\nDon't worry about a thing\nJust dance, dance, dance\n\n[Chorus]\nHey!\nIt feels right girl just give me a sign\nWe're gonna party all night\nHave the time of our life, yeah\nI can't fight how I'm feeling' inside\nWe can party all night\nHave the time of our life, girl\n\n[Bridge][x2]\nOh oh woah\nOh oh woah\nWe're gonna party all night\nP-par-party all night, girl\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can't help myself, cause girl you're so fly\nI knew from the minute that I looked in your eyes\nThat you could be the one, you're just my type\nCan't let you get away, it's obvious\nI'm into you\nNo one else compares to you\nJust do what you do and I will be there for you\nIf you take my hand (my hand), just give me the chance (the chance)\nSay don't worry about a thing\nJust dance, dance, dance\n\n(Don't worry girl)\nHey!\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nNo we don't have to leave tonight\nWe'll stay together on the dance floor\nTurn up the sound, turn down the lights\n(The lights, the lights, the lights)\n(Don't wanna let go, yeah)\nLet's make a night we won't forget\nAnd living with no regrets\nAnd no one else but us\nTil the sun comes up\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ed20fea6a648b60134d86d3306b98a6.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "Big Time Rush"}
