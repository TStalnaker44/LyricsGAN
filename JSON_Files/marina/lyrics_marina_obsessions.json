I can't sleep\nOne minute I'm a little sweetheart\nAnd next minute you are an absolute creep\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've got obsessions\nI want to wipe out all the sad ideas\nThat come to me when I am holding you\nWe've got obsessions\nAll you ever think about are sick ideas\nInvolving me, involving you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSupermarket, oh, what packet of crackers to pick?\nThey're all the same, one brand, one name, but really they're not\nLook, look, just choose something quick\nPeople are staring, time ticker-quicking, skin is on fire\nJust choose something, something, something\nPressure overwhelming\nNext minute, I am turning out of the door\nFacing one week without food\nA day, a day, when things, things are pretty bad\nBut don't let it make you feel sad\nThe crackers were probably bad luck anyway\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan't let your cold heart be free\nWhen you act like you've got an OCD\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've got obsessions\nI wanna erase every nasty thought\nThat bugs me every day of every week\nWe've got obsessions\nYou never told me what it was that made you strong\nAnd what it was that made you weak\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've got obsessions\nI want to erase every nasty thought\nThat bugs me every day of every week\nWe've got obsessions\nYou never told me what it was that made you strong\nAnd what it was that made you weak\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(We've got obsessions)\nThat made you weak, made you weak\nMade you weak\n(We've got obsessions)\nMade you weak, made you weak, made you...\n\n[Outro]\nSunday, wake up, give me a cigarette\nLast night's love affair is looking vulnerable again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70f5f6a7b749f005cc81ce17531da2d3.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
