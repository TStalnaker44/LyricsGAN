Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne track mind, one track heart\nIf I fail, I'll fall apart\nMaybe it is all a test\n'Cause I feel like I'm the worst\nSo I always act like I'm the best\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you are not very careful\nYour possessions will possess you\nTV taught me how to feel\nNow real life has no appeal\nIt has no appeal, it has no appeal\nIt has no appeal, it has no appeal\nIt has no appeal\n\n[Chorus]\nI know exactly what I want and who I want to be\nI know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine\nI'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy\nOh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!\nI know exactly what I want and who I want to be\nI know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine\nI'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy\nOh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly\nI'm gonna fail, I'm gonna die\nI'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly\nI'm gonna fail, gonna die, die, die, die\n\n[Chorus]\nI know exactly what I want and who I want to be\nI know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine\nI'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy\nOh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!\nI know exactly what I want and who I want to be\nI know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine\nI'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy\nOh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!\n\n[Outro]\nOh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7f49ecededbd3013e6dfcd63ad10ee4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
