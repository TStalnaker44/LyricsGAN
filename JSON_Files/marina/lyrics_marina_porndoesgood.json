I just learned to play three chords on my new, um, baby pink ukulele.  I play like a child. Don't care, 'cause it's helped me write a wonderful song, um, called Porn Does Good.  It's about people never admitting to, um, watching porn, girls and boys.  Maybe some of you haven't.  Maybe some of you have!  So, whether you have or haven't, um, I reckon you should learn this song and walk down the street and sing it out loud with pride.  Um, uh... [laughs]  And, um, yeah. I would love if you did that and I would even love it if you video'd it and sent it to me. [laughs]\nBecause I don\u2019t think anyone would actually do that\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'd rather go home and watch pornography alone\nI've got a big collection, a really huge selection\nAnd if I'm really desperate, I'll call my ex up\nAnd have sex on the phone\nIt beats orgasming alone\n\n[Chorus]\nPorn is good for the soul\nBut it doesn't leave you feeling very whole\nUnless you own a good dildo\nBut then I bet you think I'm a whore\n\n[Verse 2]\nSex is a drug, so throw me a bone\nIt's so innocent, that's why I always go home alone\n'Cause I'm feeling ashamed that I feel like a boy\nOh, women are meant to act coy\nThat's why we've bought all these toys\n\n[Chorus]\nPorn is good for the soul\nBut it doesn't always leave you feeling whole\nUnless you own a good dildo\nBut then you'll all think I'm a whore\n\n[Outro]\nI don't care\nI don't care\nI don't care", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0488f4b6a6eaa454411e14a31e3ee80f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
