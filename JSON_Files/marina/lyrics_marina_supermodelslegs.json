Eat cake!\nGo cheer! Drink beer!\nWorrying is boring\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf people said \"eat loads of cake\"\nYou wouldn't want much anyway\nAnd then you would stuff your face\nAnd look like King Henry the Eighth\nInstead we're told off every day\nFor living our lives the wrong damn way\n\"Suck my left one\"'s what I say\nIf I want six coffees a day\n\n[Hook]\nWomen, men, and in-betweens\nWhy don't you just stop dieting?\nGo bake! Eat cake!\nGo cheer! Drink beer!\nWorrying is boring\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh I get more turned on by big cupcakes than heroin\nNot 'rock and roll' and much more 'Mary Poppins'\n\n[Chorus]\nOh supermodel's legs\nThey never held up much weight in my world\n(Oh oh, oh oh)\nOh supermodel's legs\n'Cause women should be women\nGirls should be allowed to be girls\n(Oh oh, oh oh)\n\n(Too right!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0488f4b6a6eaa454411e14a31e3ee80f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
