'Cause I got too much pride\nPass the parcel, wrap, unwrap, and open up the locks\nOut come flying all the secrets of Pandora's box\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nOh, you think I'm unfit\nLittle did you know that I was cut for it\nNo glass slipper will ever fit\n'Cause I could never see a diamond in it\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to the family jewels\nCoal to diamond, sold to fools\nWelcome to the family jewels\nSimmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool\nI can't keep my cool\nI can't keep my cool\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd when we're in the dark, it echoes in your heart\nAnd when you're far away, it beckons me to stay\nAnd when we're in the dark, it echoes in your heart\nAnd when you're far away, it beckons me to stay\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to the family jewels\nCoal to diamond, sold to fools\nWelcome to the family jewels\nSimmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool\nI can't keep my cool\nI can't keep my cool\nWelcome to the family jewels\nCoal to diamond, sold to fools\nWelcome to the family jewels\nSimmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool\nI can't keep my cool\nI can't keep my cool", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d24c8d209b983fdfde2a2ce2e90f5635.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
