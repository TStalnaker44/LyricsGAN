Cuckoo!)\nCuckoo! (Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nTen silver spoons coming after me\nOne life with one dream on repeat\nI'll escape if I try hard enough\nTill King of the Jungle calls my bluff\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, Lord (Oh, Lord)\nI have been told (I have been told)\nThat I must take the unforsaken road\nForsaken road\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a fork in the road\nI'll do as I am told\nAnd I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know\nWho I wanna be\n\n[Refrain]\nCuckoo! (Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)\nCuckoo! (Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)\nCuckoo! (Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)\nCuckoo! (Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou say Y-E-S to everything\nWill that guarantee you a win?\nDo you think you will be good enough\nTo love others and to be loved?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, Lord (Oh, Lord)\nNow I can see (Now I can see)\nThe cutlery will keep on chasing me\nForsaken road\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a fork in the road\nI'll do as I am told\nAnd I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know\nWho I wanna be\n\n[Bridge]\nWe are the spoons, metal-ly mean\nWe scooped our way into your dreams\nTo knock the knives out bloody cold\nAnd lead you down the unforsaken road\nForsaken road\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a fork in the road\nI'll do as I am told\nAnd I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know\nWho I wanna be\nCuckoo!", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/4e72081e5a9d7073820188530a318271.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
