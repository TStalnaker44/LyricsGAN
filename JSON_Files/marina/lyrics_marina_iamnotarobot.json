I'm not a robot, a robot\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou've been hanging with the unloved kids\nWho you never really liked and you never trusted\nBut you are so magnetic, you pick up all the pins\nNever committing to anything\nYou don't pick up the phone when it ring, ring, rings\nDon't be so pathetic, just open up and sing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm vulnerable, I'm vulnerable\nI am not a robot\nYou're loveable, so loveable\nBut you're just trouble\n\n[Chorus]\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot\n\n[Bridge]\nCan you teach me how to feel real?\nCan you turn my power off?\nAnd let the drum beat drop\n\n[Chorus]\nGuess what? I am not a robot\nGuess what? I am not a robot\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot\nGuess what? I'm not a robot, a robot", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/d703cd1c8d6ab75d417373a3c7daa072.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MARINA"}
