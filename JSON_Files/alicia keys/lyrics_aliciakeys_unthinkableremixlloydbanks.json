Shady past but you can brighten up my view\nCause when I\u2019m standing next to you. Ain\u2019t nothing I can\u2019t do but\nYou deserve to have me with you like you with me\nThrough thick and thin ?\nSix feet, more than loyal ?\nHeard a couple about you too, but I ain't flipping out on you\nNever mind the jealous focus on what we do\nThrough tall waters, you're the mask I breathe through, I need you\n\n[Verse One - Alicia Keys]\nMoment of honesty\nSomeones gotta take the lead tonight\nWhose it gonna be?\nI\u2019m gonna sit right here\nAnd tell u while it comes to me\nIf u have something to say\nU should say it right now (you should say it right now) (are you ready)\n\nU give me a feeling that I never felt before\nAnd I deserve it, I know I deserve it (let it go)\nIts become something that\u2019s impossible to ignore\nAnd I can\u2019t take it\n\n[Hook - Alicia Keys]\nI was wondering maybe\nCould I make you my baby\nIf we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy (crazy)\nIf you ask me I\u2019m ready\nIf you ask me I\u2019m ready\n\n[Verse - Two - Alicia Keys]\nI know u said to me\n\u201cThis is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be\u201d\nTime is only wasting so why wait for eventually\nIf we gonna do something about it\nWe should do it right now (we should do it right now)\n\nU give me a feeling that I never felt before\nAnd I deserve it, I know I deserve it\nIts become something that\u2019s impossible to ignore\nIts what we make it\n\n[Hook - Alicia Keys]\nI was wondering maybe\nCould I make you my baby\nIf we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy\nOr would it be so beautiful either way I\u2019m sayin\nIf you ask me I\u2019m ready\nIf you ask me I\u2019m ready\n\n[Bridge - Alicia Keys]\nWhy give up before we try\nFeel the lows before the highs\nClip our wings before we fly away\nI can\u2019t say I can\u2019t compare\nI\u2019m suspended it the air\nWon\u2019t u come be in the sky with me\n\n[Hook - Alicia Keys]\nI was wondering maybe\nCould I make you my baby\nIf we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy (crazy)\nOr would it be so beautiful either way I\u2019m sayin\nIf you ask me I\u2019m ready\nIf you ask me I\u2019m ready", "image": "https://images.genius.com/38a105840763b3cef597180a5f426321.441x441x1.png"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
