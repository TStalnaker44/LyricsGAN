Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\n\n[Chorus]\nIn New York!\nConcrete jungle where dreams are made of\nThere's nothing you can't do\nNow you're in New York!\nThese streets will make you feel brand new\nBig lights will inspire you\nHear it from New York", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f3706e1003adefe4eb0ac3c0a5f2abd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
