Oh\nDon't you do it, no, said don't you leave me this way\nI don't know if I can lift my head and face another day\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, it's such a lonely road (Where do we go from here?)\nAll I can do is\nFollow the tracks of my tears (Tears)\n\n[Bridge]\nUsually not the kinda girl who's lost and looking for direction\nWho could this be, staring at me?\nWhen I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution\nMe too far gone, to find my way home\n\n[Outro]\nWhere do we go from here?\nAll I can do is\nFollow the tracks of my tears, oh\nWhere do we go from here?\n(Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay)\nAll I can do is\nFollow the tracks of my tears (Follow either way)\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28381d54e51ea464fec72e39e7d7b222.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
