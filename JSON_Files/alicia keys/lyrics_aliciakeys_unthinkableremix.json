Either way, I'm sayin'...\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)\n\n[Bridge: Alicia Keys]\nYeah, yeah\nSing...\nWhy give up before we try?\nFeel the lows before the highs\nClip our wings before we fly away (fly away)\nI can't say I came prepared\nI'm suspended in the air\nWon't you come be in the sky with me?\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nI was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?\nIf we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?\nOr would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/71bae20ee54342f6f5ff043e50c1edb9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
