So he said, \"Blow black mother, black mother.\" He always announce the title and say, \"black mother.\" This is rap, this is hip hop, this is all that, from the street. Poetry from the street\n\nBlack mother, I must confess that I still breathe\nThough you are not yet free\nWhat could justify my crying start\nForgive my coward's heart\nBut blame me not the sheepish me\nWhile I be sleeping in a deep-deep sleep\nAnd I be hazed and dazed and\nVipers fester in my hair\nBlack mother, I curse your drudging years\nThe rapes and heart-breaks, sweat and tears\nBut I swear on siege night dark and gloom\nA rose I'll wear to honor you, and when I fall\nThe rose in hand\nYou'll be free and I a man\nFor slave of natural death who dies\nCan't balance out to two dead flies\nI'd rather be without the shame\nA bullet lodged within my brain, black mother", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4d46e56b4950d2b18a8a745d1fb4918a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
