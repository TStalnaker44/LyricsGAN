Oh, whoa, oh, oh\n(Just pick up the motherfuckin' phone, man)\nAyye\nYeah, baby...mmm\n\n[Verse 1]\nI keep your picture beside my bed\nAnd I still remember everything you said\nI always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong\nAlways thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone\n(And I'm not trying to hear that shit)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat I wanna know, baby\nIf what we had was good\nHow come you don't call me anymore?\n\n[Verse 2]\nStill light the fire on a rainy night\nI still like it better when your holding me tight\nEverybody said\nEverybody said that we should never part (Mmm)\nTell me baby, baby, baby, why\nWhy you wanna go and break my heart?\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanna know is baby\nIf what we had was good\nHow come you don't call me anymore?\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes it feels like I'm gonna die\nIf you don't call me Papa\nOh, you gotta try\nI'll get down on my knees\nHoping you please, please, please\nOoh, won't you call me sometime, Papa?\n\n[Outro]\nWhy on earth\nCan't you just pick up the phone?\nYou know I don't like to be alone\nHow come you don't call me?
