(Find the words to say goodbye)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know now I was naive\nNever knew where this would lead\nAnd I'm not tryin' to take away, oh no\nFrom the good man that he is\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut how do I let go when I've\nLoved him for so long and I've\nGiven him all that I could?\nWas it somethin' wrong that we did\nBecause others infiltrated?\nWhat went wrong with somethin' once so good?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do you find the words to say\nTo say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)\nWhen your heart don't have the heart to say\nTo say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)\n\n[Bridge]\nIs this the end, are you sure?\nHow should you know when you've never been here before?\nIt's so hard to just let go\nWhen this is the one and only love I've ever known\n\n[Middle 8]\nSo, how do you find the words to say\nTo say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)\nWhen your heart don't have the heart to say\nTo say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do you find the words to say\nTo say goodbye (Find the words to say goodbye)\nWhen your heart don't have the heart to say\nTo say goodbye? (Find the words to say goodbye)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3e101ac3e39c4a62eb4eedaececa0c6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
