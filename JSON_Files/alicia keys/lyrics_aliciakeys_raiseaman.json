(Oh, yeah)\n'Cause every time you're around me\nI feel virgin all over again\nAnd every time you're all around me\nHow can I renege? Boy, I just need your hand\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs it okay that I'm not independent?\nIs it okay that I...\nIs it okay that I show weakness?\nIs it okay that I...\nIs it okay that I can't wait to see you?\nIs it okay that I...\nIs it okay to love a man right now?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you understand\nThen show me your hands (Ooh, ooh)\nShow me your hands\nBoy, if you understand\nSomebody raise a man (Ooh, ooh)\nRaise a man\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've never been treated a way I didn't wanna be treated\nIt's hard to explain, I know it's hard to believe\nI want what's comin' to me\nPerfection, protection, please love\nWith me all night long (Oh)\nMakin' love to our favorite song\nYour love teaches me how to love\nSo deep, baby, it's so sweet\nCan't wait to pass you down\nTo the face that resembles you and me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs it okay that I'm not independent?\nIs it okay that I...\nIs it okay that I show weakness?\nIs it okay that I...\nIs it okay that I can't wait to see you?\nIs it okay that I...\nIs it okay to love a man right now?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you understand\nThen show me your hands (Ooh, ooh)\nShow me your hands\nBoy, if you understand\nSomebody raise a man (Ooh, ooh)\nRaise a man\n\n[Bridge]\nOh-oh-oh\nOh-oh\nEvery day and every night I pray for one accord\nI adore you even more\nAnd every minute that passes me by\nWe can't afford for us to be ignored\nSay we need each other more than we know (Oh, oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody made a man\nTo show me how to raise a man (Ooh, ooh)\nRaise a man\nYou can't be a man\nIf we don't raise a man (Ooh, ooh)\nRaise a man\nIf you want a man\nThen you gotta raise a man (Ooh, ooh)\nRaise a man\nIf you understand\nThen show me your hands (Ooh, ooh)\nShow me your hands", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efaed7f0822f0c5a4700cb08ba65e3e8.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
