Why not try?\nThis constant game I play to stay high\nBut all is just a state of mind\nAll is reality of your choice\nConstant evolution, constant adaptation\nConstant state of moving nowhere\n\nFootsteps, silence is loud\nKindness is brave, wisdom is long\nLoving is necessary, I need it, we need it\nSearching, looking for the satisfaction\nIt is nowhere, it is everywhere\n\nPreaching, pleading, praying for God to come\nWhat are we waiting for?\nWhy are we so afraid of taking charge?\nBut it's always changing, always\nIn the constant state of going nowhere\n\nWe all have demons to battle, roads to walk\nCrosses to bear, mistakes and sins\nCandles and their steady glow\nWater and its constant crash\n\nEndless horizon, rocks of times long gone\nStill strong, still here and so are we\nHere we are forever\nThe constant state of going nowhere\n\nThe constant state of going nowhere\nConstant state of going nowhere\nCon-con-constant state of moving nowhere\nConstant state of moving nowhere\n\nIt's like a jungle\nIt's like a jungle\n\nIt's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here\nAnd my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death\nAlways feels like a race against father time\nIn the streets of New York\n\nAll I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people\nOnly crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane\nThe revolution has to start, don't waste no time\nIn the streets of New York\n\nNew York, New York, New York, New York, New York City\nNew York, New York, New York, New York, New York City\nNew York, New York, New York, New York, New York City\nNew York, New York, New York, New York, New York City\n\nLivin' in the city\nLivin' in the city\nNew York, New York City\nLivin' in the city\n\nLivin' in the city\nLivin' in the city\nNew York, New York City\nLivin' in the city\n\nLivin' in the city\nLivin' in the city\nNew York, New York City\nLivin' in the city\nLivin' in the city", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f7227b56571735eefddf16380bbebb7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
