(Uh-huh)\nDid this cold, cold world turn us into stone?\nWell, now all I battle is your ego and your pride\nIt's ticking like a time bomb ready to ignite\nHurtin' me to fight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo who's gonna rescue us from ourselves?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen we gonna wake up, baby?\nIt's time for lovin'\nWhen we gonna wake up, my baby?\nBefore it's too late\nWhen we gonna wake up, baby?\nIt's time for lovin'\nWhen we gonna wake up, my baby?\nBefore it's too late\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen the smoke clears\nWhat will be left for us but tears and pain?\nWhy must we argue over the same things\nJust to make up and go back again?\nIt's never to late, it isn't too long\nCan't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong\nGotta get outta bed\nAnd take a look at what's goin' on\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, when we gonna wake up, baby?\nIt's time for lovin'\nWhen we gonna wake up, my baby?\nBefore it's too late\nWhen we gonna wake up, baby?\nIt's time for lovin'\nWhen we gonna wake up, my baby?\nBefore it's too late\nWhen we gonna wake up, baby?\nIt's time for lovin'\nWhen we gonna wake up, my baby?\nBefore it's too late\n\n[Outro]\nOh baby (Wake up)\nOh darlin' (Wake up)\nWhen we gonna wake up? (Wake up)\nWhen we gonna take a look and see? (Wake up)\nWhat's goin' on? (Wake up)\nOh, what's goin' on? (Wake up)\n'Cause we're wastin' so much time (Wake up)\nAnd we're 'bout to lose it all (Wake up)\nOh baby, baby, baby (Wake up)\nSaid I need you, baby\nOh, I need my baby home\nBring my baby back to me (Wake up)\nOh (Wake up)\nOh baby (Wake up)\n(Wake up)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/231b1a24fa863b347c70fca202708286.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
