Singing\n\n[Chorus]\nYou...are...\nYou...are...\n\nYou...are...\nYou...are...\n\nYou...are...\nYou...are...\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd nothing else compares\nAnd nothing else compares\nAnd nothing else compares\n\n[Chorus]\nYou...are...\nYou...are...\n\nYou...are...\nYou...are...\n\n[Outro]\n(Home) Home\nWhere I wanted to go\n\n(Home) Home\nWhere I wanted to go\n\n(Home) Home (You...)\nWhere I wanted to go (are...)\n\n(Home) Home (You...)\nWhere I wanted to go (are...)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/38a105840763b3cef597180a5f426321.441x441x1.png"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
