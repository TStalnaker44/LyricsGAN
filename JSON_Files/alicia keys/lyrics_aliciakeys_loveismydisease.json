Oh\nAnd I'm not sure if this is healthy\nIs it a sickness?\n'Cause I feel like I'm losin' my mind\nAnd I know that there's no medicine\nNothing I can take, no remedy\nBaby, please stay\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, when you're gone, it feels like\nMy whole world's gone with you\nI thought love would be my cure\nBut now it's my disease (My disease)\nI try to act mature\nBut I'm a baby when you leave\nHow can I ever get used to being without you? (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, oh, oh baby, baby, baby, baby\nI get a fever\nJust the thought of you leaving my side\nOh, and I'm not the same 'til you're back holding me\nThat's all I need\nOh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)\nMy whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)\nI thought love would be my cure\nBut now it's my disease (My disease)\nI try to act mature\nBut I'm a baby when you leave\nHow can I ever get used to being without you?\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, here's what I'm going through when you're gone\nSome serious symptoms of withdrawal\nTossing and turning in my bed\nWaking up drenched in a cold sweat\nLying here longing for you\nWhat am I supposed to do\nWhen I'm stuck and I can't get enough of your love?\nOh, whoa, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)\nMy whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)\nI thought love would be my cure\nBut now it's my disease (My disease)\nI try to act mature\nBut I'm a baby when you leave\nHow can I ever get used to being without you?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c05547367307453fe500889cda9321c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
