Who are you? You look so familiar\nI know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got way too much in common\nIf I'm being honest with you\nWe got way too much in common\nSince I'm being honest with you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWho wants to love somebody like me?\nYou wanna love somebody like me?\nIf you could love somebody like me\nYou must be messed up too\nWho wants to love somebody like me?\nYou wanna love somebody like me?\nIf you could love somebody like me\nYou must be messed up too\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe used to talk 'til midnight\nAll those days that you stayed at my house\nWe were just passing the time\nWhen we were young and we ain't had no vows\nNow, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply\nWe both know we had no patience together day and night\nGetting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied\nI could love you all occasions\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got way too much in common\nIf I'm being honest with you\nWe got way too much in common\nSince I'm being honest with you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWho wants to love somebody like me?\nYou wanna love somebody like me?\nIf you could love somebody like me\nYou must be messed up too\nWho wants to love somebody like me?\nYou wanna love somebody like me?\nIf you could love somebody like me\nYou must be messed up too\n\n[Bridge]\nMessed up too, messed up too\nJust like you, just like you\nMessed up too, messed up too\nJust like you, just like you\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got way too much in common\nIf I'm being honest with you\nWe got way too much in common\nSince I'm being honest with you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWho wants to love somebody like me?\nYou wanna love somebody like me?\nIf you could love somebody like me\nYou must be messed up too\nWho wants to love somebody like me?\nYou wanna love somebody like me?\nIf you could love somebody like me\nYou must be messed up too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/214748087f403386907c51e942ecb32b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
