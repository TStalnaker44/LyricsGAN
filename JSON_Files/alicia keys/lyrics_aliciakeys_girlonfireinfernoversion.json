'Cause I fear God\nAnd in my backyard, that's a deer, God\nAnd that's a horse ranch, and to my core fans\nKeep reppin' me, do it 'til the death of me\n'X' in the box, 'cause ain't nobody checkin' me\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nThis girl is on fire (fire, fire)\nThis girl is on fire\nShe's walking on fire (fire, fire)\nThis girl is on fire\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh...\nShe's just a girl, and she's on fire", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf2478d690c28b0e85d12d56faf31d90.564x564x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Alicia Keys"}
