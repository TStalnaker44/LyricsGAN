I said I did it\nDid you do it? I said I did it\nBut I backed out quick because I thought I split it\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, my God!\nThey come with the rough stuff\nBoy, we hit it, split it, and forget it\nIn the same order as you hear\nBut boy I'm not fronting (me not front)\nDon't ask what, me tell you the truth, you understand me eye?\nThe iron eye can get pissy, you know what I'm saying?\nClean up me rifle, clean up me rifle\nClean up me rifle, me elephant rifle\nClean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle\nClean up me rifle, elephant rifle\nYou know, you know, you [?]\nYou make them tingle, yeah, you make them tingle\n\n[Verse 3]\nI flipped her from the top of my head, enough said\nI'm the brother with the short, short dreads\nA couple different styles, a couple different flows\nJust some that my souls about some girls I know\nI gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto\nAnd I cover up the moans by turning up my stereo\n\n[Chorus]\nDid you do it? You know I did it\nDid you do it? You know I did it\nDid you do it? You know I did it\nI let the seat recline and I hit it\nDid you do it? Yo, you I did it\nDid you do it? Yo Mark, I said I did it\nDid you do it? Yo\nI backed out quick cause I thought I split it\n\n[Interlude]\n(You didn't do it, he didn't do it)\nI made her go\n\n[Refrain]\nWaiting for you, just waiting\nWaiting for you\nWaiting for you, just waiting\nWaiting for you\n\n[Outro]\nYo man, she been waiting, she keep on waiting\nYeah, she been waiting, and you have not hit it\n\n\n[Dave Murphy]\n[Andr\u00e9 Betts]\n\n\nYo, Dr\u00e9...
