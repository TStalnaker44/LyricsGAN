I think not\nI want out\n\n[Chorus]\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone\n(This love affair)\nIt's so sad\n(This love affair)\nWhat we had\nGone, gone, gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nBleeding, bleeding\nThen comes the recognition\nAnger seething\nI don't need your permission\nAnd I don't know who you are\nAnd this thing has gone too far\nIs this love, I think not\nI want out\n\n[Chorus]\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone\n(This love affair)\nIt's so sad\n(This love affair)\nWhat we had\nGone, gone, gone\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're in too deep\nYou cannot keep\nThe promises you made\nOur happiness was free\nThe end of love\nThe end of the dream\nGone, gone, gone\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I don't know who you are\nAnd this thing has gone too far\nIs this love, I think not\nI want out\n\n[Chorus]\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone\n(This love affair)\nIt's so sad\n(This love affair)\nWhat we had\nGone, gone, gone\n(This love affair)\nGone, gone, gone\nThis love affair is over\nGone, gone, gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1e19ca73495e02efd884bfa21a1d119.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
