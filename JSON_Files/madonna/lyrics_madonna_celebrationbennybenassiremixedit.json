Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nCome join the party\nYeah\nLet's get this started\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nI think you wanna come over\nYeah, I heard it through the grapevine\nAre you drunk? Are you sober?\nThink about it, doesn't matter\nAnd if it makes you feel good, then I say do it\nI don't know what you're waiting for\n\n[Verse 2]\nBoy you got a reputation\nBut you\u2019re gonna have to prove it\nI see a little hesitation, am I gonna have to show you\nThat if it feels right, get on your mark\nStep to the beat boy, that's what it's for\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPut your arms around me\nWhen it gets too hot we can go outside\nBut for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear\nAn invitation to the dance of life\n\n[Chorus]\nCome join the party\nIt's a celebration\n'Cause anybody just won't do\nLet's get this started\nNo more hesitation\n'Cause everybody wants to party with you\nCome join the party\nIt's a celebration\n'Cause anybody just won't do\nLet's get this started\nNo more hesitation\n'Cause everybody wants to party with you\n\n[Spoken Interlude]\nHaven't I seen you somewhere before?\nYou look familiar\nYou wanna dance? Yeah\nI guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on\n[Laughter]\nWhat are you waiting for?
