It's all true\nIt's true. It makes me cry\n\nWhen the funeral was through\nI had myself a barbecue\nDaddy's bones they sure taste good\nI couldn't have stopped; if only I could\n[or: I'd have killed him myself; if only I could]\n\nOh dear daddy\nYou're not gonna see me sad\n'Cause everything you did was bad", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e976e2c129781fb6a14dbc2cea188539.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
