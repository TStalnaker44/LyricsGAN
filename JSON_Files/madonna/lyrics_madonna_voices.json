Who is the slave?\n\n[Verse 1: Madonna]\nTreat me like a curse\nThen tell me I'm your savior\nI'm living with a stranger\nI used to know so well\nWaiting for your answer\nIs a kind of torture\nCould I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]\nAre you walking the dog?\n'Cause that dog isn't new\nAre you out of control?\nIs that dog walking you?\nHaven't you had enough?\nNow your time is up\nBaby, show me your hand\n\n[Chorus: Madonna]\nVoices start to ring in your head\nTell me what do they say\nDistant echoes from another time\nStart to creep in your brain\nSo you claim madness\nLike it's convenient\nYou do it so often that you start to believe it\nYou have demons so nobody can blame you\nBut who is the master and who is the slave?\n\n[Verse 2: Madonna]\nFirst you say you love me\nThen you want to leave me\nThen you say you're sorry\nYou play the game so well\nI bought your illusion\nYou're the greatest salesman\nHow could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]\nAre you walking the dog?\n'Cause that dog isn't new\nAre you out of control?\nIs that dog walking you?\nHaven't you had enough?\nNow your time is up\nBaby, show me your hand\n\n[Chorus: Madonna]\nVoices start to ring in your head\nTell me what do they say\nDistant echoes from another time\nStart to creep in your brain\nSo you claim madness\nLike it's convenient\nYou do it so often that you start to believe it\nYou have demons so nobody can blame you\nBut who is the master and who is the slave?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f677a711dcfb9da2b87fc68e9103f0f4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
