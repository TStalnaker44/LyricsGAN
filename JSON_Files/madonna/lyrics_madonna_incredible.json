get my head around it, I need to think about it)\n(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)\nAnd all of those things that used to get you down\nNow have no effect at all\n'Cause life is beautiful\n(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)\n(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)\n\n[Verse 1: Madonna]\nRemember in the very first time\nYou caught that someone specials eye\nAnd all of your care dropped\nAnd all of the world just stopped\n\n[Interlude 1: Madonna]\n(I hope)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]\nI wanna back to then\nGotta figure out how, gotta remember when\nI felt it (hmm)\nIt thrilled me (hmm)\nI want it (hmm)\nTo fill me\n\n[Chorus 1: Madonna]\nJust one of those things\nWhen everything goes incredible\nAnd all is beautiful\n(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)\n(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)\nAnd all of those things that used to get you down\nNow have no effect at all\n'Cause life is

everything in life just goes wrong\nFeels like nobody's listening\nAnd something is missing\n\n[Interlude 1: Madonna]\n(I hope)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]\nI wanna go back to then\nGotta figure out how, gotta remember when (hmm)\nI felt it (hmm)\nIt thrilled me (hmm)\nI want it (hmm)\nTo fill me\n\n[Chorus 1: Madonna]\nJust one of those things\nWhen everything goes incredible\nAnd all is

one, you were my friend\nYou gave me life, you were the sun\nYou taught me things, I didn't run\nI fell to my knees, I didn't know why\nI started to breathe, I wanted to cry\nI need a reminder so I can relate\nI need to go back there before it's too late\n\n[Bridge 1: Madonna]\nIt's time to get your hands up\nIt's time to get your body groovin'\nIt's time to get your hands up\nIt's time to get your body groovin'\nIt's time to get your hands up\nIt's time to get your body groovin'\nIt's time to get your hands up\nIt's time to get your body groovin'\n\n[Chorus 1: Madonna]\nJust one of those things\nWhen everything goes incredible\nAnd all is beautiful\n(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)\n(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)\nAnd all of those things that used to get you down\nNow have no effect at all\n'Cause life is beautiful\n(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)\n(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)\n\n[Chorus 2: Madonna]\nIncredible\nLet's finish what we started\nIncredible\nYou're welcome to my party\n\n[Bridge 2: Madonna, Pharrell Williams, Both]\nI don't want this to end\nI am missing my
