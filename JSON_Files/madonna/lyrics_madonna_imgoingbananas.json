Ese bato loco!\n\n[Verse]\nI'm going bananas\nAnd I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas\nFor I'm going bananas\nI'm non compos mentes\nAnd I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist\nFor I'm non compos mentes\nWho knows?\nCould be the tropic heat\nOr something that I eat\nThat makes me gonzo\nI do carry on so, for I'm going bananas\nSomeone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas\nFor I'm going bananas\nI'm going meshuga\nAll day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing \"Booga wooga\"\nBut I'm going meshuga\nThere's bats in my belfry\nWon't you make sure this straight jacket's tight\nOtherwise I might get myself free\nYes, there's bats in my belfry\nWho knows?\nCould be the wine I drink\nOr it's the way I think\nThat makes me gonzo\nOh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas\nSomeone get me a bed in the \"Casa de Loco\" for all my mananas\nFor I'm going bananas\nYes, I'm going bananas\nSi, I'm going bananas", "image": "https://images.genius.com/94a49d0063d872202e3cfb98147dcc3b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
