I walk around with a smile on my face\n'Cause you're close to me, well I know you're somewhere\n\nGonna take my chance on a different kind of romance\nA supernatural thing, gonna have my fill\nIt gives me such a big thrill to be with a supernatural thing\n\nAnd I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined\nYou know just what I want and I don't have to ask\nAre you reading my mind?\n\nYou're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare\nYou're not the least bit obsessed with your hair\nYou're not upset when I come home later than ten\nFor a ghost you're a very good friend\n\nI've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say\nThey already think I'm crazy, I wouldn't like to wake up\nAnd find myself in the family way, a ghost baby\n\nGonna take my chance on a different kind of romance\nA supernatural thing, gonna have my fill\nIt gives me such a big thrill to be with a supernatural thing\n\nI can't see you, so hot, I know you're out there\nYou little rascal, stop that\n\nI've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say\nThey already think I'm crazy, I wouldn't like to wake up\nAnd find myself in the family way, a ghost baby\n\nGonna take my chance on a different kind of romance\nA supernatural thing, gonna have my fill\nIt gives me such a big thrill to be with a supernatural thing\n\nGonna take my pants off for a different kind of romance\nThat super-duper naturally big thing, it's outrageously large\nSuper-duper, supernatural, so hot, so hot, supernatural", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0e84acaae1ad020d44433ee890474e14.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
