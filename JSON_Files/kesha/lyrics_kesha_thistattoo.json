What's wrong with you?)\nFor once, I'll admit, she was right\nTechnically there's finally no forever with you\n(I don't know what you were thinking about Kesha, really)\nReally, you're outta my life, the ink has dried\n(What did I say? What did I say)\n\n[Chorus]\nNow what do I, what do I\nWhat do I do about this tattoo?\nOh, what do I, what do I\nWhat do I do, what can I turn it into?\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe I can take the E and turn it into a tree\nOr maybe I can take the heart\nAnd turn it into some sort of tribal art\nOr just find someone with the same name\nWho isn't so lame, la la, who isn't so lame\nLa la la la la, who isn't so lame\nWith the same name who isn't so lame\nLa la la la la, who isn't so lame\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat do I, what do I\nWhat do I do about this tattoo?\nOh, what do I, what do I\nWhat do I do about this tattoo?\nOh, what do I, what do I\nWhat do I, what do I\n\n[Outro]\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nWith the same name\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nWhat do I, what do I, what do I do\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/90df5cbd82e159bcd14c6ab311929fa0.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
