Why can't you see?\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you, don't leave me to myself\nYou're perfect, now change me to someone else\nYou break me, repair me, always leave some piece behind\nI'm totally, sanely all mixed up\nBeen losing my mind to controlling thoughts\nTemptation is torture, it's teasing me\nPleasing me (yeah, eh, yeah)\n\n[Verse 3]\nTwisted, tangled, deep and shallow\nIn confusion, lost and found in love's illusion\nAlmost tasted, but find it wasted\nResolution, what I'm really tryin' to say is\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you, don't leave me to myself\nYou're perfect, now change me to someone else\nYou break me, repair me, always leave some piece behind\nI'm totally, sanely all mixed up\nBeen losing my mind to controlling thoughts\nTemptation is torture, it's teasing me\nPleasing me (yeah, eh, yeah)\nI hate you, don't leave me to myself\nYou're perfect, now change me to someone else\nYou break me, repair me, always leave some piece behind\nI'm totally, sanely all mixed up\nBeen losing my mind to controlling thoughts\nTemptation is torture, it's teasing me\nPleasing me (yeah, eh, yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c0a7458241cbe551f3125d50407691ff.632x632x1.png"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
