God is a woman, I know her\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if rich, white, straight men\nDidn't rule the world anymore?\n(Hahahahahahahahaha)\nWhat if rich, white, straight men\nDidn't rule the world anymore?\n(Hahahahahahahahaha)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you're from another land, then come here\nYou won't have to climb a wall\n(Yes, you will!)\nAnd if you are a boy who loves a boy\nYou'll get a wedding cake and all\n(Not in Colorado!)\nAnd if you are a lady and you do your lady work\nThen you will make as many dollars as the boys\nNot just two thirds\n\n[Refrain]\nCha-ching\nFuck you (Fuck you)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat if life as we knew it was over?\nGuess what?
