Call me all day long\nCome on, I'm not yours to own\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nWhy you asking things you don't need to know?\nChecking with my girls, looking through my phone\nI want to take this slow, so just leave it, leave it alone\n\n[Hook]\nLeave it, leave it alone, leave it, leave it alone\nLeave it, leave it alone, leave it, leave it alone\n\n[Post-Hook]\nHey, girl, I know, I know\nThat I keep callin' you on the phone\nBut I can't, but I can't, can't leave it alone\nI know, I know that I keep callin' you on the phone\nBut I can't, can't, can't, can't, can't leave it alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're not my man, no, you're not my man, yes\nAnd if you act like this baby I'll forget you\nI'm not ready yet\nYou were not the first, might not be the last\nGonna break your heart, if you move too fast\nThen you'll be on your own so just leave it, leave it alone\n\n[Hook]\nLeave it, leave it alone, leave it, leave it alone\nLeave it, leave it alone, leave it, leave it alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere we go again with the questions\nI'm a girl that needs my independance\nNo, I can't be with you every second\nLeave it alone\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nWhy you asking things you don't need to know?\nChecking with my girls, looking through my phone\nI want to take this slow, so just leave it, leave it alone\n\n[Hook]\nLeave it, leave it alone, leave it, leave it alone\nLeave it, leave it alone, leave it, leave it alone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a96f77413ba7f87041ae3f005252c665.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
