This hurts me baby\nBoy you'll never know\nBut I just can't sit here regretting\nGotta let you go\nIf we're meant to be forever\nThen it's down the road\nIf you really care about me\nLet me go\n\n[Chorus]\nSo baby, let my love, let my love go\nBaby, let me live, I've got to go\nMaybe one day I'll be yours, who knows?\nBaby, my love, let my love go\n(Baby, gotta let me go)\nMy love, let my love go\n(Gotta let me go)\nMy love, let me love go\nBaby, let my love, let my love go\nBaby, let me live, I've got to go\nMaybe one day I'll be yours, who knows?\nBaby, my love, let my love go\n(Baby, gotta let me go)\nMy love, let my love go\n(Let me go)\nMy love, let me love go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b321bea875a6019f2ec2a6ae64f0ea67.480x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
