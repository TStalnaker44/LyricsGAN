Which one was the wittiest?\nWhich one was the shittiest to me?\nYour suburban little cult wouldn't have me know\nBut you sure found the time to tease me\nYou always looked perfect, yeah, so what, I cared\nNow I'm down with who I am, but you're still stuck up there\n\n[Chorus]\nStuck up little bitches, Who do you think you are?\nDid you break a nail while you were tearing me apart?\n\n[Verse 2]\nSince we're talking serious, I was just delirious\nChanging my appearance to please you\nStraightening my hair, my clothes\nTook the ring out of my nose\nGiggling all the time, how gross to be you\nYour greatest ambitions, your social position\nBut who's gonna give up when you're all grown now?\n\n[Chorus]\nStuck up little bitches, who do you think you are?\nDid you break a nail while you were tearing me apart?\nStuck up little bitches, stuck right there in your place\nDid you get a blemish on your little pretty faces?\n\n[Verse 3]\nStripped of spite, I'm trying to say\nYou only gave me minor scrapes\nAnd never really broke the skin\nNo hate, no fake, it's just what it is\n\n[Chorus]\nStuck up little bitches, who do you think you are?\nDid you break a nail while you were tearing me apart?\nStuck up little bitches, stuck right there in your place\nDid you get a blemish on your little pretty faces?\n\n[Verse 4]\nAll I ever wanted was to be like you\nAnd now I don't look back and wonder\nWho I am 'cause I don't really know\nAnd maybe your rejection made me stronger\nTripped me up, but not for long\n'Cause I'm up front with who I am\nAnd being real is never wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nStuck up little bitches, who do you think you are?\nDid you break a nail while you were tearing me apart?\nStuck up little bitches, stuck right there in your place\nDid you get a blemish on your little pretty faces?\nStuck up little bitches, who do you think you are?\nDid you break a nail while you were tearing me apart?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a96f77413ba7f87041ae3f005252c665.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
