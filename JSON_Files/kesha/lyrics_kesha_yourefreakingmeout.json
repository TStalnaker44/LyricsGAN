(What is this all about?)\nYou're freaking me out\nYou're freaking me out\n\n[Bridge]\nTrippy delusions, romantic intrusions\nConsume me, I'm floating down the isle\nAnd you're smiling\nGross!\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook at you, look at me\nNo way I could have seen this coming\nGot me thinking crazy things\nHow can this be happening?\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?\nWhat happened to my sanity?\nThe whole damn thing is not for me, not with you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're freaking me out\nYou're freaking me out\nWhat's this all about?\nYou're freaking me out\nYou are freaking me out\nYou're freaking me out\nYou're freaking me out\nWhat's this all about?\nYou're freaking me out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b9dd9cfec14a2c5a1cfde5849bfb27d.877x877x1.png"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
