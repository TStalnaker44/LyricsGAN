{"songs": [{"title": "About \u201cWarrior\u201d - Commentary", "album": "Warrior (Album Commentary)", "year": "2012-11-30", "lyrics": "\"Warrior\" was a song that was obviously special enough to me to name my album after it, but it's also more of an idea that, instead of being a victim, I'm always gonna be a warrior, no matter what anybody throws at me or what kind of shit I go through, I'm not gonna be a victim. I'm gonna be a warrior.\n\nI think that is something my fans, my animals, can relate to. 'Cause we've all been put through shit no matter what it is, everybody's had to deal with something. But instead of, you know, letting it take over, and letting whatever or whoever that is win and beat you down, stand up and face it and fight it.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68f5c0fd683efe72071525367ba6103e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
