Why won't you give me mine?\n\n[Chorus]\nDowntown, yeah you know the place, oh\nGoin' downtown, goin' downtown\nDowntown, put a smile on my face, oh\nGoin' downtown, goin' downtown\nDowntown, whoa, downtown\nYou know what I'm talkin' 'bout\nDowntown, whoa, see into my heart\nWhen you're goin' downtown", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a96f77413ba7f87041ae3f005252c665.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
