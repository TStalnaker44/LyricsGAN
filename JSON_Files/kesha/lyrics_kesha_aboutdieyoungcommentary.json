And I really love the sentiment of the song, it's all about how you should live every single day and every single night as if it's your last. 'Cause you really never know how life goes, and no matter how old I get I will always remain young at heart.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68f5c0fd683efe72071525367ba6103e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
