My imagination, or\nDo I get too high? I'm hoping that I might, 'cause\nI'm falling fast, got me trippin'\nMy mind keeps on slipping more into this infatuation\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDidn't think I'd ever come around\nTo my hallucination\nNever thought I'd let my walls come down\nTo my hallucination\nDidn't think I'd fall in love again\nTo my hallucination\nSo I'm gonna make myself give in\nTo my hallucination\n\n[Verse 2]\nCould it be this all is a dream?\nA mirage, my mind playin' tricks on me\n'Cause it looks like the night's fading into light\nYou took the wheel, put my heart in drive\nI don't want the drama, no comedown\nGonna go with the flow, gonna ride it out\n'Cause I think I see the rainbow through the rain\n'Cause I'm feelin' kinda funny when I hear your name\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThink I might be fallin' hard again and it feels\nSo magical, I'm hoping that this feeling's for real, so\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this a hallucination? My imagination, or\nDo I get too high? I'm hoping that I might, 'cause\nI'm falling fast, got me trippin'\nMy mind keeps on slipping more into this infatuation\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDidn't think I'd ever come around\nTo my hallucination\nNever thought I'd let my walls come down\nTo my hallucination\nDidn't think I'd fall in love again\nTo my hallucination\nSo I'm gonna make myself give in\nTo my hallucination\n\n[Bridge]\nGot a lot of things runnin' through my head now\nEverybody always says somethin' different, but\n(But I think I see the rainbow through the rain)\nI gotta have faith in what I am seeing\nBoy, you give me something I can believe in now\n(Feelin' kinda funny when I hear your name)\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this a hallucination? My imagination, or\nDo I get too high? I'm hoping that I might, 'cause\nI'm falling fast, got me trippin'\nMy mind keeps on slipping more into this infatuation\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDidn't think I'd ever come around\nTo my hallucination\nNever thought I'd let my walls come down\nTo my hallucination\nDidn't think I'd fall in love again\nTo my hallucination\nSo I'm gonna make myself give in\nTo my hallucination\n\n[Outro]\nMy hallucination, tion, oh\nMy hallucination, tion, oh\nMy hallucination, tion, oh\nMy hallucination, tion, oh\nMy hallucination, tion, oh\nMy hallucination, tion, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb701584e5f018f6aa9d679073d88a78.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
