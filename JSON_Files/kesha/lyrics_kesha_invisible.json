For you notice me\nI must be invisible, I am invisible\n\n[Verse 2]\nNothing's real and nothing matters\nFell apart, the pieces scattered\nI could disappear without a trace\nI'm all around but can't get in\nI'm on the outside looking in\nLike the wind, I'll blow you all away\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep looking at you, keep looking right through\nLike I'm invisible\nWho do I have to be? For you notice me\nI must be invisible, I am invisible\n\n[Bridge]\nYou make me what I am\nI can't believe you didn't see the sunlight\nSo if I'm invisible, who's ever gonna pin me with a crime?\nI am invisible, I am, I am, I am\nI am invisible, I am, I am, I am\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep looking at you, keep looking right through\nLike I'm invisible\nWho do I have to be? For you notice me\nI must be invisible, I am invisible", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ee6d7ab04ea2a74a319e197c848838a8.632x632x1.png"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
