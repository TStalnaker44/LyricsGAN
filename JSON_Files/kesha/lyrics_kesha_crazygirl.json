How do you do these things to me?\nYou're like a magician, I can tell you got tricks up your sleeve\nYou're like a bull fighter, you got me feeling all riled up, feisty\nLike a punk rocker, you make me want to break things\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do you do it, do it, do it, do it?\nHow do you do it, do it, do it to me?\nYou make me feel giddy and meticulous\nYou make me feel a million different things\nYou make me into a crazy, crazy girl, girl, girl\nCrazy girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need a straight jacket whenever I get around you\nCause you're like a magnet, I can't help it, I have to touch you\nYou're a dirty pirate, that's what I love about you\nI don't feel worthy, you give me something to bow down to\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do you do it, do it, do it, do it?\nHow do you do it, do it, do it to me?\nYou make me feel giddy and meticulous\nYou make me feel a million different things\nYou make me into a crazy, crazy girl, girl, girl\nCrazy, crazy girl\n\n[Bridge]\nYou make me act a little insane\nYou impair my judgment, you infect my brain\nLike a hallucinogenic, an amphetamine\nYou really know how to get to me\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do you do it, do it, do it, do it?\nHow do you do it, do it, do it to me?\nYou make me feel giddy and meticulous\nYou make me feel a million different things\nYou make me into a crazy, crazy girl, girl, girl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c6341d7d65dbf7a4eb0ad49241466067.733x733x1.png"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
