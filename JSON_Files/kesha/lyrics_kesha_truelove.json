Is this true love?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalk by and I'm a nervous wreck\nThe way you smell, the way you dress (it's so perfect)\nMy tongue is tied 'cause I can't\nTranslate these feelings inside, ide, ide, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't speak, I am terrified\n'Cause if I say the wrong thing\nYou might see how hard I'm trying\nIs this made up or true love?\nIs this true love? Is this true love?\n\n[Bridge]\nI want to tell you my secrets\nI'll tell you everything\nMy heart is racing\nI'm waiting for some sign from you\nHow do I say it to my true love? (True love)\nTell me you feel it too, my true love (true love)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't speak, I am terrified\n'Cause if I say the wrong thing\nYou might see how hard I'm trying\nIs this made up or true love?\nIs this true love?
