I'm nothing more than recycled stardust and borrowed energy, born from a rock, spinning in the aether. I watch my life backwards and forwards and I feel free. Nothing is real, love is everything, and I know nothing.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d38f67d979eeef72827af914c8e9733.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kesha"}
