I walk down the hallway\nYou like it? The bedroom's my runway\nSlap me! I'm pinned to the doorway\nKiss, bite, foreplay\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets\nI know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me\nMy wicked tongue, where will it be?\nI know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me\nIt's what we see\nI know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me\nIt's where we go, it's where we'll be\nI know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you\nOnto you, I'm onto you\nOnto you, you must be onto me\nYou must be onto me\nYou must be onto me\nYou must be onto me\n\n[Outro]\nOn to you, I'm on to you\nOn to you, I'm on to you\nOn to you, I'm on to you\nOn to you, I'm on to you\nMe, me, me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/60bf9993b5085ae2c484e7d0425e88c8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
