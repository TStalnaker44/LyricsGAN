Oooh\nCause if we are, we're taking this a little too far\nMe being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are\nWe're taking this a little too far\n\n[Background Vocals: Drake]\nKnow you wanna roll with a good girl?\nDo it big do it all for a good girl\nOne time, this is a song for the good girl\nDon't sleep when you know you got it good girl\nOne time, this is a song for the good girl\nWanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl\nOne time, this is a song for the good girl\nAnd I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should\nWassup\n\nOn my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom\nAlone in my place, my heart is away\nAll that I can think of is, we should get married\nWe should get married\nLet's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away\n\nStop making a big deal out of the little things\nCause I got big deals and I got little things\nGot everything I'm asking for but you\nStop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away\nCome right now, you know where I stay\n\nI just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine\nI just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine\nFuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine\n\nMTV Welcome to my world!\n\nMUSIC CUE: GHOST\n\nReap what you sow\nPerfection is so...

around in that H-town\nIf there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell\nStop acting so scared, just do what I tell\nFirst go through my legs, go back on your head\nAnd whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true\n\nBaby put your arms around me\nTell me I'm the problem\nKnow I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted\nUnderneath the pretty face is something complicated\nI come with a side of trouble\nBut I know that's why you're staying\n\nBecause\nYou're\nNo\nAngel\nEither, baby\n\nMUSIC CUE: JEALOUS\n\nSometimes I want to walk in your shoes\nDo the type of things that I never ever do\nSo I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself\n\"Baby girl, you can't survive like this.\"\n\nNo, no, no\n\nAnd I hate you for your lies and your covers\nAnd I hate us for making good love to each other\nAnd I love making you jealous but don't judge me\nAnd I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing\nThat ain't nothing\nI'm just
