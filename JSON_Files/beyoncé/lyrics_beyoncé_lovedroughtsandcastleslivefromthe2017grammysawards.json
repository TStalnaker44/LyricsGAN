Or am I not thirsty, enough?\nI don't care about the lights or the beams\nSpend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me\nOnly way to go is up, skin thick, too tough\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain\nYou, you, you, you and me could calm a war down\nYou, you, you, you and me could make it rain now (make it rain now)\nYou, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought\n\nPt. 2 Sandcastles\n\n[Intro: Lemonade Speech]\nIf we're gonna heal\nWe gonna start again,\nYou are the magician pulling me back together again,\nThe way you cut me in half.\n\nMake the woman in doubt disappear.\nHer heaven would be a love without betrayal.\nYou look nothing like your mother,\nYou look everything like your mother.\n\n[Verse]\nWe built sandcastles that washed away\nI made you cry when I walked away\nAnd although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby\nEvery promise don't work out that way\n\nAnd your heart is broken 'cause I walked away\nShow me your scars and I won't walk away\nAnd I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby\nEvery promise don't work out that way, no no no no no\nEvery promise don't work out that way\n\n[Outro]\nThere is a curse,\nThat will be broken.\nOne thousand girls raise their arms.\nNow that reconciliation is possible,\nIf we gonna heal,\nLet it be glorious.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/995535bff9a0a15e5f1840990707d61d.399x399x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
