You're real social\nI don't like the way you're looking\nDon't get too close\nI'm about to take you down to booking\n\n[Beyonce']\nC'mon and touch me D I know you want to\n\n[Mekhi]\nLook, I only need your prints\nDon't really care about your frontal\n\n[Beyonce']\nI don't see me living another day\nWithout your tender kisses\nWhy don't we retire to the room\nPut on some Luther, light some incents\nGet to know one another just a little better\nThan we do now\n\n[Mekhi]\nYou trying to act like I'm not a cop\n\n[Beyonce']\nYou can bring the cuffs, if you would like to\nIf that's your style\n\n[Mekhi]\nLooks let's get it straight, you cease and disist\nI got some platinum bracelets\nI'm about to squeeze on ya wrists\n\n[Beyonce']\nBut you don't understand the way that I feel\nThe pain I could heal\n\n[Mekhi]\nI could lose my job for this\nThere is no way we could chill\n\n[Beyonce']\nSo why you bring me this far\nNow let's try to be real\nCause only time will reveal\nIf you still playing the field\nEvery second that you stay is like an hour we will\nI got a couple days to kill\nEither you down or you peel\n\nI don't want anything without you in my life\nYou are my baby\nWhy don't you forget about your girl\nAnd say you want me as your lady\nGet to know one another just a little better\nThan we do now\nGive in to everything you're feeling that's surprising\nLet's make love now\n\n[Mekhi]\nNah, I don't think so\nYour body is like weed smoke though\nLight-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go\n\n[Beyonce']\nIt ain't about getting locked\nCause it's your steeze I need\nMy heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat\n\n[Mekhi]\nOh no!
