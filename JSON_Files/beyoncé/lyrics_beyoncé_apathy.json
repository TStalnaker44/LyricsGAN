Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head. Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb p*ssy who, because of me, sleep evaded. Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening. Her heaven will be a love without betrayal. Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/995535bff9a0a15e5f1840990707d61d.399x399x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
