And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86527286e5623e09de9082461be09538.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
