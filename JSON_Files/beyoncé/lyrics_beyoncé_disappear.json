Sasha Fierce", "year": "2008-11-18", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIf I begged and if I cried\nWould it change the sky tonight?\nWould it give me some light?\nShould I wait for you to call?\nIs there any hope at all?\nAre you drifting by?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I think about it\nI know that I was never there or even cared\nThe more I think about it\nThe less that I was able to share with you\nI try to reach for you, I can almost feel you\nYou're nearly here\nAnd then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)\nYou disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd when I lie all by myself\nI see your face, I hear your voice\nMy heart stays faithful\nAnd time has come and time has passed\nIf it's good, it's got to last\nIt feels so right\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I think about it\nI know that I was never there or even cared\nThe more I think about it\nThe less that I was able to share with you\nI try to reach for you, I can almost feel you\nYou're nearly here\nAnd then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)\nYou disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)\nYou, you disappear\n(Disappear, disappear, disappear)\n\n[Bridge]\nI missed all the signs, one at a time\nYou were ready\nWhat did I know?\nStarting our lives\nNow my love, I'm ready to show\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I think about it\nI know that I was never there or even cared\nThe more I think about it\nThe less that I was able to share with you\nI try to reach for you, I can almost feel you\nYou're nearly here\nAnd then you disappear\nYou disappear, you disappear\nYou disappear, disappear", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58d26525c9a03274f975d39fc60e4713.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
