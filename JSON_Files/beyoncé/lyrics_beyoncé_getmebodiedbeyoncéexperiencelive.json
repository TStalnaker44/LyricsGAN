Beyonc\u00e9 & Swizz Beatz]\nMission one\nI'ma put this on\nWhen he see me in this dress\nI'ma get me some, hey\nMission two\nGotta make that call\nTell 'em get the bottles popping\nWhen they play my song, hey\nMission three\nGot my three best friends\nLike we do it all the time\nWe gon' do it again, hey\nMission four\nGot the vintage rolls\nDrop a couple hundreds\nTell 'em leave it at the door\nI ain't worried\nDoing me tonight\nA little sweat\nAin't never hurt nobody\nWhile y'all standing on the wall\nI'm the one tonight--\n\n[Chorus 1: Beyonc\u00e9 & Swizz Beatz]\nGetting bodied\nGetting bodied\nGetting bodied\nGetting bodied!\nGetting bodied\nIf you want my body\nWon't you get me bodied?\nYou want my body\nWon't you get me bodied?\nCan you get me bodied?\nI wanna be myself tonight\nCan you get me bodied?\nI wanna be myself tonight\nDon't you see my body?\nI wanna let it out tonight\nWanna party, wanna dance\nWanna be myself tonight\nGet me bodied\n\n[Verse 2: Beyonc\u00e9 & Swizz Beatz]\nMission five\nSkip to the front of the line\nLet me fix my hair\n'Fore I go inside, hey\nMission six\nGotta check these chicks\n'Cause you know they gon' block\nWhen I take these flicks, hey\nMission seven\nGotta make my rounds\nGiving eyes to the guys\nNow I think I found him, hey\nMission eight\nWhile we're conversating\nWe can skip small talk\nLet's get right to the chase\nI ain't worried\nDoing me tonight\nA little sweat\nAin't never hurt nobody\nWhile y'all standing on the wall\nI'm the one tonight--\n\n[Chorus 2: Beyonc\u00e9 & Swizz Beatz]\nGetting

know enough to know\nIf you can get me bodied\nI'm kinda tight\nI'm feeling right\nEnough to see somebody\nI wanna let it off tonight\nWanna dance, wanna party\nWanna be myself tonight\nCan you get me bodied?\nI wanna be myself tonight\nCan you get me bodied?\nI wanna be myself tonight\nDon't you see my body?\nI wanna let it out tonight\nWanna party, wanna dance\nWanna be myself tonight\nGet me

beat\nAnd your body's touching me\nAll I need\nIs to let it be\nAin't no worries, no\nBoy, dance with me\nFeel my body\nDon't stop\nJust come closer to me\nWhile we grind to the beat\nAnd your body's touching my body\nGetting bodied\nAin't no shame\n'Cause I gotta get mine\nI swing my hair\nKick off my shoes\nCome here, boy\nLet me work on you\nI ain't worried\nDoing me tonight\nA little sweat\nAin't never hurt nobody\nWhile y'all standing on the wall\nI'm the one tonight--\n\n[Chorus 3: Beyonc\u00e9 & Swizz Beatz]\nGetting bodied\nGetting bodied\nGetting bodied\nGetting bodied!\nGetting bodied\nIf you want my body\nWon't you get me bodied?\nYou want my body\nWon't you get me bodied?\nHey\n\n[Bridge: Beyonc\u00e9 & Swizz Beatz]\nLadies on the floor\nAll my ladies on
