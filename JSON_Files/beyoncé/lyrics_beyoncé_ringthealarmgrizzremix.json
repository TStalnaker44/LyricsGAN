Is that the price that I pay?\nBut this is my show and I won't let you go\n\nAll has been paid for, and it's mine\nHow could you look at me\nAnd not see all the things?\nShe go be rockin' chinchilla coats\n\nIf I let you go\nGetting the house off coast\nIf I let you go\nShe goin' take everything I own\n\nIf I let you go\nI can't let you go\nDamn, if I let you go\nShe goin' rock them VVS stones\n\nIf I let you go\nCouped in the 'bach or the Rolls\nIf I let you go\nShe goin' profit everything I taught\n\nIf I let you go\nI can't let you go\nDamn, if let you go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eaa99051c60a202b3ca3c289619680e7.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
