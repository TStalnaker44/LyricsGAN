That could be us.\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nLovers used to make love\nAnd died just to give us\nTheir piece of the beautiful\nRemember when we made love?\nLove\nWasn't it beautiful?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't ask me why\nThe sky's blue; that's not my business\nAll I know is I\nLook up and tell myself\n\"Be patient, love. That could be us.\"\n\n[Bridge]\nDiamonds used to be coal (Be coal)\nLook young 'cause they got soul (got soul)\nAnd my heart used to be cold (be cold)\n'Til your hands laid on my soul\nSomebody's got to stay deep in love\nThat could be you\nThat's why we're beautiful\nThat's why you're beautiful\nOoh\n\n[Outro]\nWhy, why?\nThat's why you're beautiful\nThat's why you're beautiful\nThat's why you're beautiful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58d26525c9a03274f975d39fc60e4713.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
