This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable rights\" of \"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check \u2014 a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice\n\n[Verse 1: Beyonc\u00e9]\nTryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder\nTell the storm I'm new\nI'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular\nPainting white flags blue\nLord forgive me, I've been running\nRunning blind in truth\nI'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love\nTell the sweet I'm new\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nI'm telling these tears, \"Go and fall away, fall away\"\nMay the last one burn into flames\nSing it, y'all\n\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nFreedom! Freedom! I can't move\nFreedom, cut me loose!\nFreedom! Freedom! Where are you?\nCause I need freedom too!\nI break chains all by myself\nWon't let my freedom rot in hell\nHey! I'ma keep running\nCause a winner don't quit on themselves\n\n[Verse 2: Beyonc\u00e9]\nI'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters\nTell the tide, \"Don't move\"\nI'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders\nCall me bulletproof\nLord forgive me, I've been runnin'\nRunnin' blind in truth\nI'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love\nTell the deep I'm new\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nI'm telling these tears, \"Go and fall away, fall away\"\nMay the last one burn into flames\n\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nFreedom!
