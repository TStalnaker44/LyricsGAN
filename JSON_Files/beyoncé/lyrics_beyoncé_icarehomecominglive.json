Well, that's okay\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I care\nI know you don't care too much\nBut I still care, baby\nOh, I care\nI know you don't care too much\nBut I still care, baby (Oh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nEver since you knew your power, you made me cry\nAnd now every time our love goes sour, you can't sympathize, baby\nYou see these tears falling down to my ear\nI swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah\nI try to tell you all my fears\nYou still don't care? Well, that's okay\nListen, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I care\nI know you don't care too much\nBut I still care, baby\nOh, I care\nI know you don't care too much\nBut I still care, baby\n\n[Bridge]\nBoy, maybe if you cared enough\nI wouldn't have to care so much\nWhat happened to our trust?\nNow you're just givin' up\nYou used to be so in love\nNow you don't care no more\n\n[Interlude]\nOoh, ooh, do-do-do do do-do-do\nDo-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do\nOoh, ooh, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I care\nI know you don't care too much\nBut I still care, baby\nOh, I care\nI know you don't care too much\nBut I still care, baby\n\n[Outro]\nI still care, baby\nI still care, yeah\nI still care\nLa-la-la, la-la-la", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86527286e5623e09de9082461be09538.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
