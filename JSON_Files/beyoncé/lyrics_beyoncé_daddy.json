We were inseparable)\nAnd I remember when you could do no wrong\nYou'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you\nI was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause you loved me, I overcome, yeah\nAnd I'm so proud of what you've become\nYou've given me such security\nNo matter what mistakes I know you're there for me\nYou cure my disappointments and you heal my pain\nYou understood my fears and you protected me\nTreasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why\u2026\nI want my unborn son to be like my daddy\nI want my husband to be like my daddy\nThere is no one else like my daddy\nAnd I thank you for loving me\nDaddy, daddy, daddy...\n\n[Verse 2]\nI still remember the expression on your face\nWhen you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend\n(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)\nI still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo\nCould have said \"Beyonc\u00e9, I told you so\"\nInstead you said you'd get one too\n(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)\n\n[Chorus]\nWords can't express my boundless gratitude for you\nI appreciate what you do\nYou've given me such security\nNo matter what mistakes I know you're there for me\nYou cure my disappointments and you heal my pain\nYou understand my fears and you protected me\nTreasure every extraordinary memory and that's why\u2026\nI want my unborn son to be like my daddy\nI want my husband to be like my daddy\nThere is no one else like my daddy\nAnd I thank you for loving me\n\n[Bridge]\nEven if my man broke my heart today\nNo matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay\n'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced\nFor this love is unconditional it won't go away\nI know I'm lucky\nKnow it ain't easy\nFor men who take care of their responsibilities\n\n[Chorus]\nLove is overwhelming\nLord, why did you pick me?\nCan't stop my tears from falling\nI love you so much daddy\n\n[Outro]\n(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)\nI get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you\nI get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you\nThere is no one else like my daddy\nNo one else replace my daddy...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c8a2ba97f1a7a4f7dd98c04eda3a9235.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
