WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.\n\nWE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.\n\nTHESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.\n\nTHIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED, WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER.\n\nFEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.\n\nWE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INTO ACTION. WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.\n\nWHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF ALTON STERLING AND PHILANDO CASTILE, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.\n\nCLICK IN TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN YOUR AREA. YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD.\n\n\u2014BEYONC\u00c9", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fc6b28e6061db9fc4419677fde825857.882x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
