(After she saves the world)\n(After she saves the world)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy\n(I'm crying out for help)\nSometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me\nSave me from myself\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's there to save the hero\nWhen she's left all alone\nAnd she's crying out for help?\nWho's there to save the hero?\nWho's there to save the girl\nAfter she saves the world (After she saves the world)\nAfter she saves the world? (After she saves the world)\n(After she saves the world)\n\n[Outro]\n(After she saves the world)\nAfter she saves the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58d26525c9a03274f975d39fc60e4713.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
