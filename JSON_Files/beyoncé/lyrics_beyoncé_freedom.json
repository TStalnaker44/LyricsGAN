Freedom! I can't move\nFreedom, cut me loose! Yeah\nFreedom! Freedom! Where are you?\n'Cause I need freedom, too!\nI break chains all by myself\nWon't let my freedom rot in hell\nHey! I'ma keep running\n'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves\n\n[Verse 2: Beyonc\u00e9]\nI'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters\nTell the tide, \"Don't move\"\nI'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders\nCall me bulletproof\nLord, forgive me, I've been runnin'\nRunnin' blind in truth\nI'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love\nTell the deep I'm new\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nI'm telling these tears, \"Go and fall away, fall away,\" oh\nMay the last one burn into flames\n\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nFreedom!

I'ma keep running\nCause a winner don't quit on themselves\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nTen Hail Marys, I meditate for practice\nChannel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards\nEight blocks left, death is around the corner\nSeven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona\nSix headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)\nFive-O askin' me what's in my possession\nYeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts\nFire hydrants and hazardous\nSmoke alarms on the back of us\nBut mama, don't cry for me, ride for me\nTry for me, live for me\nBreathe for me, sing for me\nHonestly guidin' me\nI could be more than I gotta be\nStole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy\nCode on me, drive on me\nWicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah\nOpen correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)\nOpen our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)\nOpen the streets and watch our beliefs\nAnd when they carve my name inside the concrete\nI pray it forever reads\n\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\nFreedom! Freedom! I can't move\nFreedom, cut me loose!\nFreedom! Freedom! Where are you?\n'Cause I need freedom, too!\nI break chains all by myself\nWon't let my freedom rot in hell\nHey! I'ma keep running\n'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nWhat you want from me?\nIs it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?\nWhat you want from me?\nIs it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?\nHear me out\n\n[Spoken: Hattie White]\nI had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/59fc635f7dbe6b5cd1e07e5e605c96b5.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
