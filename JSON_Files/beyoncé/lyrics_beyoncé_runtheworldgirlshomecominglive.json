Girls\n\n[Interlude: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]\nWe teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller\nWe say to girls: \"You can have ambition, but not too much\nYou should aim to be successful, but not too successful\nOtherwise, you will threaten the man\"\nWe raise girls to see each other as competitors\nNot for jobs or for accomplishments\nBut for the attention of men\nFeminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86527286e5623e09de9082461be09538.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
