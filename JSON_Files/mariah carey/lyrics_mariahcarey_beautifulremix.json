ASAP!\nHold up wait, hit both brakes\nFuck third base 'cus I hit home plate\nI'mma party hard like the disco days\nFat black plaques and them french fold braid\nCause homie pack steel, like below waist\nShawty got grill, like Chipotle\nNow my favorite meal be the shrimp lo mein\nBut still... (You're beautiful)\n\n[Verse 2: Miguel]\nHop on the back of my bike\nLet the good wind blow through your hair\nWith an ass like that and a smile so bright\nOh, you\u2019re killing me, you know it ain\u2019t fair, yeah\nRide on through the middle of the night\nLet the moonlight kiss your skin\nWhen you dance like that, your jeans so tight\nOh, you\u2019re killing me, baby do it again\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nYou\u2019re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful\nAnd I can\u2019t pretend that that doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah\nYou\u2019re beautiful, good lord, you\u2019re fucking beautiful\nAnd I can\u2019t pretend that that doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]\nI like when you run red lights\nDon\u2019t stop \u2019til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me\nAlways in control, how you do it, I don\u2019t know\nBut I don\u2019t care, take me anywhere\n\u2018Cause it\u2019s beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible\nAnd I can\u2019t pretend that that doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah\n\n[Hook: Miguel & Mariah Carey]\n\n[Outro]\nOh oh oh oh\nYeah yeah\nYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing darling\nHop on back my bike darling\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nDon\u2019t you worry darling", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9390cdec4bd0c13c83010725f7c4eab6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
