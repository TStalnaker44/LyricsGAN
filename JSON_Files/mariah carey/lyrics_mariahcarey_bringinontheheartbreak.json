Can't you see?\n\n[Bridge]\nNo, no, no\nHey, babe\nYou got the best of me\nOh, can't you see? (Oh, can't you see?)\nYou got the best of me (You got the best of me)\nOh, can't you see? (Oh, can't you see?)\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak\nBringin' on the heartbreak\n(You're bringin' on the heartbreak)\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak\n(You're bringin' on, bringin' on)\nBringin' on the heartache\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak\nBringin' on the heartache\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak (Can't you see?)\nBringin' on the heartache\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8bb7abc0e13058ded0207a4a68140627.600x521x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
