I had a little extra time\nSo I figured I might as well explain\nA couple little things to you\nThat you probably never knew\nLike you'll always be an intrinsic part of me\nEven though life goes on\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you really need me\nBaby, just reach out and touch me\nYou don't ever have to be downhearted again\nIf she hurts you or misleads you\nBaby, all you ever need to do is call me and let love rush in\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd my love will flow\nLike the waves to the shore\nYou can fall into me\nOnce again effortlessly\nAnd I'll comfort you so\nYour heart won't hurt anymore\nI'm waiting patiently\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you really need me\nBaby, just reach out and touch me\nYou don't ever have to be downhearted again\nIf she hurts you or misleads you\nBaby, all you ever need to do\nIs call me and let love rush in\n(If she hurts you or misleads you)\nIs call me and let love rush in\n(You can just call me, baby)\nIf you really need me\nBaby, just reach out and touch me\nYou don't ever have to be downhearted again\nIf she hurts you or misleads you\nBaby, all you ever need to do\nIs call me and let love rush in\nIf you really need me\nBaby, just reach out and touch me\nYou don't ever have to be downhearted again\nIf she hurts you or misleads you\nBaby, all you ever need to do\nIs call me and let love rush in\nIf you really need me\nBaby, just reach out and touch me\nYou don't ever have to be downhearted again\nIf she hurts you or misleads you\nBaby, all you ever need to do\nIs call me and let love rush in", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1edbe4b12bb10007cc8b28a8cf1883e.589x588x1.png"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
