(Where?)\nBaby, you're slipping away from me (You're so far)\nTime after time I reach for you\nI try and I try but you're so aloof (Baby, baby)\nWhere is the boy that you used to be?\nBaby, you're slipping away from me (You're so far)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo far, so far, you're slipping away, away\nYou're slipping away from the life and the love we made\nBaby, I'm so afraid\nSo far, so far, you're slipping away, away\nYou're slipping right out of my grasp\nAnd you're fading so fast, it seems\nYou know you're slipping away from me\n\n[Outro]\nTime after time I reach for you\nI try and I try but you're so aloof\nWhere is the boy that you used to be?\nBaby, you're slipping away from me (So far)\nTime after time I reach for you\nI try and I try but you're so aloof (So far, yeah)\nWhere is the boy that you used to be?\nBaby, you're slipping away from me (So far away)\nTime after time I reach for you\nI try and I try but you're so aloof\nWhere is the boy that you used to be? (Where?)\nBaby, you're slipping away from me\nTime after time I reach for you\nI try and I try but you're so aloof\nWhere is the boy that you used to be?\nBaby, you're slipping away from me\nTime after time I reach for you\nI try and I try but you're so aloof", "image": "https://images.genius.com/17f217b3779a17d2c12a2891467d8a1f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
