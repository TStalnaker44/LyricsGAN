Then it's school!\nTake your bags and go, boo\nNever mind all of the flexing I do\nBalencia-got me two stepping on smooth (fresh)\nNever will I lower my standards, my boo\nI could show you where a ten is like Sampras on cue\nThat\u2019s kinda funny cause love still means \"lose\"\nUnless we kill a racquet in back-and-forth moves\nSomehow you keep showing\nYou act, I see through it\nUm, did you catch it? Aww, screw it!\nAll the girls need is respect and I do it\nNever catch feelings cause jets is my fuel\nGiuseppe my foot, my sweats be En Noir\nSo sexy, they ain't sweating me, bet you ain't know her!\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what to do\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what to do\nCause you wanna leave\nAnd you never go\nI'mma set you free\nBaby, you don't know\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what  to do\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what\nYou don't know what  to do\n\n[Outro]\nYou don't know what to do to me\nYou don't know what to do to me\nYou don't know\nYou don't know\nYou don't know what to do to me\nYou don't know what to do to me\nYou don't know\nYou don't know\nSaid you don't know\nYou don't know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28307f09845a01dd5b39a402fda2629e.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
