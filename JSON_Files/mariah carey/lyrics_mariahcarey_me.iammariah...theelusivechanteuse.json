I Am Mariah.\"\nPlease don't judge me for such a simplistic title\nCome on, I was only three-and-a-half\n\nIt was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself\nWith the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken\nI've kept this drawing private for so long\nBut because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today\nI've decided to share it with those of you who actually care\nAnd have been here for me through it all\nI've been through a lot, but I've always known me\nI am Mariah\n\nAlong the way there have been a couple of nicknames\nAnd I've inadvertently embodied many personas\nLately, they've been calling me, \"The Elusive Chanteuse\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5c4f5d07eafff5bb9e8820a1ea097c3b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
