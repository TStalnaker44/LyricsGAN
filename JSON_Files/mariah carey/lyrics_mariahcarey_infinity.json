Talkin' 'bout you're mad\nCould it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?\nThat\u2019s your bag, yup, that\u2019s too bad\nShow is over, you ain\u2019t gotta act\nName hold weight like kilos\nBoy, you actin' so corny like Fritos\nWouldn\u2019t have none of that without me though\nAin\u2019t none of my business, it's tea though\nOutta ammo, gotta reload\nIf life was a game, you're a free throw\nIt's nothing that you don\u2019t already know\n\n[Chorus]\nClose the door, lose the key\nLeave my heart on the mat for me\nI was yours eternally\nThere\u2019s an end to infinity\nTo infinity\nTo infinity\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow I say this? Fact that you still exist\nNo disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is\nTruthfully I\u2019m through with this\nWhy are we still doing this?\nAnswer the phone like, \"Who is this?\"\nTake your head and knock some sense\nJe ne comprends pas\nAin\u2019t no compliments (duh)\nAin\u2019t no being friends (duh)\nAin\u2019t no false pretense (duh)\nAin\u2019t no make amends (duh)\nAin\u2019t no come against (duh)\nThat\u2019s the story, ain\u2019t no happy ends\n\n[Chorus]\nClose the door, lose the key\nLeave my heart on the mat for me\nI was yours eternally\nThere\u2019s an end to infinity\nTo infinity\nTo infinity\n\n[Bridge]\nIs it lack of ice got you so cold?\nHave you ever felt this on your own?\nWhy you tryin' to play like you\u2019re so grown?\nEverything you own, boy, you still owe\n\n[Chorus]\nClose the door, lose the key\nLeave my heart on the mat for me\nI was yours eternally\nThere\u2019s an end to infinity\nTo infinity\nTo infinity\n\n[Outro]\nYou're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door\nInfinity loving me more and more\nYou're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door\nInfinity loving me more and more\n'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream\nI believe infinity is more than just a made up dream", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/194b68669d7c4d11e2da9c6b122ff170.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
