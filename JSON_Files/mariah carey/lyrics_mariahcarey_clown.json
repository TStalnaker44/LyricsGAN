Nobody, nobody, nobody!)\nWhen the star of the show isn't you anymore\nNobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down\nNobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's gonna love you when it all falls down and\nWho's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?\nWho's gonna care when the novelty's over?\nWhen the star of the show isn't you anymore\nNobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down\nNobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1edbe4b12bb10007cc8b28a8cf1883e.589x588x1.png"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
