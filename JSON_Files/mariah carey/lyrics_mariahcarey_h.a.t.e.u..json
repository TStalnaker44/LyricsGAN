(Why?)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do\nStill can't shake you off (Still can't shake you off)\nI can't wait to break through these emotional changes\nSeems like such a lost cause\nI can't wait to face you, break you down so low\nThere's no place left to go\nI can't wait to hate you\n\n[Bridge]\nNo need to call my phone 'cause I changed my number today\nAnd matter fact - I think I'm moving away (Away)\nSorry, the frustration's got me feeling that way\nAnd I just keep having one last thing to say\nAnd I just wanna hold you, touch you, feel you, be near you\nI miss you, baby, baby, baby\nI'm tired of tryin' to fake through\nBut there's nothing I can do\nBoy, I can't wait to hate you\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do\nStill can't shake you off (Still can't shake you off)\nI can't wait to break through these emotional changes\nSeems like such a lost cause\nI can't wait to face you, break you down so low\nThere's no place left to go\nI can't wait to hate you, baby (I can't wait to hate you)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ebc1ad797bf3a21eed50784f9c63ad23.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
