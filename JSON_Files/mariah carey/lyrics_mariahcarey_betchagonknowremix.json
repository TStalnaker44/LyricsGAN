Kelly]\nBefore we both get loud\nI'ma break it down\nAnd let you know what happened for real\nI was over her house\nMe and her on the couch\nAnd the whole plan was just to chill\nAnd then it got hot\nAfter taking some shots\nThe time must have slipped away\nBecause all I know\nI woke hungover\nAnd girl it was the very next day\nWith the sun in my face\nI woke up in a rage\nScreamed, \"What have you done to me?\"\nAnd I'm telling you babe\nI know it sounds crazy\nShe must have put something in my drink\nI know you don't believe it\nAnd you think I'm dead wrong\nStanding there butt naked\nWith nothing but a sheet on\nThen she came down\nWith nothing but a robe on\nAnd that's when\nI put my damn clothes on\nGot the fuck up out of there\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly & Mariah Carey]\nGirl, you know I know how it looks\n(See I know how it looks)\nGirl, you know I know how it looks\n(But baby, it ain't like that)\nGirl, you know I know how it looks\n(So don't go accusing me of something that I didn't really mean to do)\nThis is for real, for real, for real (no)\nOprah Winfrey whole segment, for real, for real (no)\n20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real (no)\n60 Minutes for real\n\n[Bridge: Mariah Carey & (R. Kelly)]\nBaby, I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through (this is not my fault, no it isn't)\nYou got me all crazy, somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk\nYour were supposed to save me, my sweet baby (but I love you, I don't love her)\nNow we're fading away (don't fade, don't fade, no)\nBut you gon' know how this feels\nEven if it's the last thing I ever do\nTo be continued...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6803b0f303b5bba84a9528acd118ff2c.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
