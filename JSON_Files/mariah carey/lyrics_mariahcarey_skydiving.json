Skydiving\nYou and me\nFloating on intimacy\nThis ain't no, one night thing\nEternal, Skydiving\nYou got me lifted baby\nOur love is like we're skydiving\nThis ain't no jump bumpin'\nWanna play? Skydiving\nYou and me\nFloating on intimacy\nThis ain't no, one night thing\nEternal, Skydiving\nYou got me lifted baby\nOur love is like we're skydiving\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo they say you got some chick\nThat keeps you warm at night along for the ride but\nIf you ask me that's bullshit\nBecause obviously heaven sent you for me no\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nSee they never told me about love or life\nBut I'm learning each moment we fly\nWhere we land is of no consequence\nWe\u2019re in tandem, it\u2019s beyond intense\n\n[Chorus]\nThis ain't no jump bumpin'\nWanna play? Skydiving\nYou and me\nFloating on intimacy\nThis ain't no, one night thing\nEternal, Skydiving\nYou got me lifted baby\nOur love is like we're skydiving\nThis ain't no jump bumpin'\nWanna play? Skydiving\nYou and me\nFloating on intimacy\nThis ain't no, one night thing (No, no)\nEternal, Skydiving\nYou got me lifted baby\nOur love is like we're skydiving\n\n[Bridge]\nLifted baby (Baby)\nGot me lifted baby (Baby)\nBoy you got me lifted baby (Baby, baby)\nAll I really want is your intimacy (Baby, baby)\n\n[Outro]\nThis ain't no jump bumpin'\nWanna play?
