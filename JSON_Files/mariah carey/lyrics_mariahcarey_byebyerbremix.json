As I protect my mother\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m her oldest son, and there are different worlds\nAnd we in the coldest one, which one did granny go to?\nAnd why do death come? As my baby ask where do babies come from\nI tell her where, I tell her why\nAnd I tell her I love her until I tell her bye\nAnd whenever I shall ever die, I hope you celebrate it\nI hope you never hate it, and they say heaven\u2019s gated\nBut I think I know the code, and let\u2019s get your life right\nBy the end of the road, that\u2019s why I drive alone down memory lane\nSo if I crash I hope you-all remember Wayne, goodbye\n\n[Bridge - Mariah Carey]\nI never knew I could hurt like this\nAnd everyday life goes on like\nI wish I could talk to you for awhile\nI wish I could find a way try not to cry\nAs time goes by\nAnd soon as you reach a better place\nStill I\u2019ll give the whole world to see your face\nAnd I\u2019m right here next to you\nIt feels like you gone too soon\nThe hardest thing to do is say bye\n\n[Chorus - Mariah Carey]\n\n[Outro - Mariah Carey]\nIt\u2019s hard to say bye, bye, bye, bye\nSo come on somebody say it with me\nWave ya hands up high\n\u2018Cause this is for my peoples who just lost somebody\nSee this is for everybody, just lift your hands to the sky\n\u2018Cause we will never say bye, bye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ead48213ebdb80718cf3acbd41997455.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
