Don't you know?\nYou gotta let him go, let him go, let him go\nX-girlfriend, you don't listen (X-girlfriend)\nStop trying, he's not gonna give in\nHe's not yours anymore, don't you know?\nYou gotta let him go, let him go, let him go\n\n[Verse 1]\nHey x-girlfriend\nIt's too bad when you had him your thing didn't work\nBut he's all mine now, so stop pursuing him\nBefore you get your feelings hurt\nSee, our love is hot and no, it won't stop\n'Cause I got him on lock\nAnd although he rejects you\nIt doesn't seem to affect you\n'Cause you just keep trying to get with him\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo don't, don't keep, keep calling\nHanging up the phone\nWhen I answer, I know it\nTears you up inside and\nWhy do you sit in silence\nOn the other end\n'Till I hang up and you\nPredictably call right back again?\n\n[Chorus]\nX-girlfriend, you can't have him\nIt's about time that you found you a new man\nHe's moved on\nDon't you know?

Don't you know?\nYou gotta let him go, let him go, let him go\nX-girlfriend, you don't listen (X-girlfriend)\nStop trying, he's not gonna give in\nHe's not yours anymore, don't you know?\nYou gotta let him go, let him go, let him go\n\n[Bridge]\nI understand why (I understand why)\nYou want him back\nBut you need to know\nOur love's too strong for you to penetrate\nIt's too late, he's not your baby no more\nX-girlfriend, x-girlfriend (It's time to let him go)\nX-girlfriend (X-girlfriend)\n(Don't listen)\nX-girlfriend\nSee, he's not gonna give in\n\n[Chorus]\nX-girlfriend, you can't have him\nIt's about time that you found you a new man\nHe's moved on\nDon't you know? Don't you know?\nYou gotta let him go, let him go, let him go\nX-girlfriend, you don't listen (x-girlfriend)\nStop trying, he's not gonna give in\nHe's not yours anymore, don't you know?\nYou gotta let him go, let him go, let him go\nX-girlfriend, you can't have him\nIt's about time that you found you a new man\nHe's moved on\nDon't you know?
