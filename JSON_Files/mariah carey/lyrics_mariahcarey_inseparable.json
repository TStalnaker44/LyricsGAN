(Breathe)\nAnd everything is off, where are you?\nGuess it's all my fault, lady sings the blues\nNo one could deny it, we were flying like United\nThought we'd never be divided\n'Cause the love we had inside us was inseparable\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're bumping this song\nAnd you're searching for the moment\nWhen two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)\nJealous of your love\n'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up\n'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable\nThought we'd stay together, always and forever\nBut now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)\nOne of us just gotta pick the phone up\n'Cause I know we're still inseparable\n(Bop bop bop bop bop)\n\n[Verse 2]\nGot photos of us on my refrigerator\nVideos on my phone (Hey)\nBoy, I just can't erase 'em\nThe first text I ever got from ya still saved in my inbox\nAnd I read it back time after time\nBoy, I'm lost, can't you look?\nWon't you please find me?\nI'm down to my last tear, come rescue me\nSee, it's broken my heart to the point where I don't leave the house, no reason out, weekends out just ain't the same without you\nBut I thought we were inseparable\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're bumping this song\nAnd you're searching for the moment\nWhen two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)\nJealous of your love\n'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up (No)\n'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable\nThought we'd stay together, always and forever (Oh babe)\nBut now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)\nOne of us just gotta pick the phone now\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's been sixteen days since I held you tight\nBalled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night\nBoy, I just wish you'd show up and make everything alright\nSo what you waitin' for?\n'Cause both us have thought that we're inseparable\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're bumping this song\nAnd you're searching for the moment\nWhen two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)\nJealous of your love\n'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up\n'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable\nThought we'd stay together, always and forever\nBut now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)\nOne of us just gotta pick the phone up\n(I know, I know, I know we are)\n'Cause I know we're still inseparable\nIf you're bumping this song\nAnd you're searching for the moment\nWhen two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)\n(I know, I know, I know we are)\nJealous of your love\n'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up\n'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable\nThought we'd stay together, always and forever\nBut now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)\nOne of us just gotta pick the phone up\n'Cause I know we're still inseparable\nIf you're bumping this song\nAnd you're searching for the moment\nWhen two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)\nJealous of your love\n'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up\n'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable\n(Gotta pick the phone up, phone up)\n(Gotta pick the phone up, phone up)\n(Oh baby, I just gotta pick the phone, the phone, the phone)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ebc1ad797bf3a21eed50784f9c63ad23.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
