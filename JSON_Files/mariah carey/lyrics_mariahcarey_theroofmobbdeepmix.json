Just me and you\nGot me stuck off the realness, just me and you\nUp on the roof beats, Pebble beach\nTalk to me anytime, even when I wit my peeps\nRuler L, why you smell like the perfume Channel?\nPush big G's rappin' all is simply heavy\nWe can do it on a roof top\nDo it 'til we both drop\nM-O-B-B with Mariah sounds so hot\n\n[Chorus: Mariah]\nEverytime (everytime) I feel the need\nI envision you caressing me\n(Envision you caressing me)\nAnd go back in time (I go back)\nTo relieve the splendor of you and I\nOn the rooftop that rainy night\n(On the roof that rainy night)\nEverytime I feel the need (when I feel the need)\nI envision you caressing me\n(I envision you over and over and over again)\nAnd go back in time (I go back)\nTo relieve the splendor of you and I\n(It was, oh, so sweet you and I)\nOn the rooftop that rainy night\n(On that rainy night)\nEverytime I feel the need\n(Last night I had the strangest dream)\nI envision you caressing me\n(It was actually quite symbolic)\nAnd go back in time\n(As I whispered that I loved you)\nTo relieve the splendor of you and I (very subtly)\nEverytime I feel the need\n(Infamous, ya don't stop, Infamous rocks your box)\nI envision you caressing me\n(Infamous knock out the box)\nAnd go back in time\nTo relieve the splendor of you and I\n(Infamous rocks your box)\nOn the rooftop that rainy night\n(Infamous knocks 'em off the box)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/14f873bcc57b1e3deef440172d81d4e3.200x200x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
