me\nAlways in control, how you do it, I don\u2019t know\nBut I don\u2019t care, take me anywhere\n\n\u2018Cause it\u2019s beautiful\nOh, you make me feel undressable\nAnd I can\u2019t pretend\nThat doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah\n\n[Breakdown]\nYou called yesterday\nTo basically say\nThat you care for me but\nThat you're just not in love\nImmediately I pretended to be feeling similarly\nAnd led you to believe I was OK\nTo just walk away from the one thing\nThat's unyielding and sacred to me\n\nWell, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it\nAnd I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you\nBut in reality I'm slowly losing my mind\nUnderneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside\nFriends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly\nBecause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering\nSo I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night\nThen turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry\n\n[I Know What You Want]\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\nYes you know I'll die for you\nAnd ya know I'll ride with you\nI will always try with you\nAnd give ya my love and cry with you\n\nI will climb a mountain high aha\nUntil I was up to touch the sky\nSo baby come and get more close to me\nThis is where your love is supposed to be\n\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\n[It's Like That]\nI came to have a party\nOpen off the Bacardi\nFeeling so hot tamale\nBoy, I know you watching me\nSo what's it going to be?\nPurple taking me higher\nI'm lifted and I like it\nBoy, you got me inspired\nBaby, come and get it\nIf you're really feeling me\n\nBecause it's my night\nNo stress, no fights\nI'm leaving it all behind\nNo tears, no time to cry\nJust making the most of life\n\nEverybody is living it up\nAll the fellows keep looking at us (because)\nMe and my girls on the floor like what\nWhile the DJ keeps on spinning the cut\nIt's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)\nIt's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)\nIt's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)\nIt's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)\n\nBecause it's\nBecause it's\nBecause it's\n\n[Crybaby]\nWhen I think of our untimely end\nAnd everything we could have been\nI cry, baby I cry\n\nOkay, so it's 5 am and I still can't sleep\nTook some medicine but it's not working\nSomeone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet\n'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep\nI finally changed my number, got a different pager\nThen last Saturday your cousin called\nTo say you're trying to reach me\nProbably because you see that I'm with someone new\n\nLate at night like a little child\nWandering 'round alone in my new friend's home\nOn my tippy toes, so that he won't know\nI still cry baby over you and me\n\nI don't get no sleep\nI'm up awake\nCan't stop thinking of you and me\nAnd everything we used to be\nAnd could have been so perfect\nStill I cry, I cry, I cry\nOh I gotta get me some sleep\nBaby and I cry, cry, cry, cry\nBaby and I cry, cry, cry, cry\n\n[The Roof]\nIt wasn't raining yet\nBut it was definitely a little misty on\nThat warm November night\nAnd my heart was pounding (pounding)\nMy inner voice resounding (resounding)\nBegging me to turn away\nBut I just had to see your face to feel alive\nAnd then you casually walked in the room\nAnd I was twisted in the web of my desire for you\n(And I was twisted)\nMy apprehension blew away\nI only wanted you to taste my sadness\nAs you kissed me in the dark\n\nEvery time I feel the need\nI envision you caressing me\nAnd go back in time\nTo relive the splendor of you and I\nOn the rooftop that rainy night\n\nAnd so we finished the Moet\nAnd started feeling liberated\nAnd I surrendered as you took me in your arms\n(You took me in your arms)\nI was so caught up in the moment\nI couldn't bear to let you go yet\nSo I threw caution to the wind\nAnd started listening to my longing heart\nAnd then you softly pressed your lips to mine\nAnd feelings surfaced I'd suppressed\nFor such a long long time (And I was lifted)\nAnd for a while I forgot the sorrow and the pain\nAnd melted with you as we stood there in the rain\n\nEvery time I feel the need\nI envision you caressing me\nAnd go back in time\nTo relive the splendor of you and I\nOn the rooftop that rainy night\nEvery time I feel the need\nI envision you caressing me\nAnd go back in time\nTo relive the splendor of you and I\nOn the rooftop that rainy night\n\nLast night I dreamed that I\nWhispered the words \"I love you, boy\"\nAnd touched you so very\nSubtly as we were kissing goodbye\n\n[Obsessed]\nAll up in the blogs saying we met at the bar\nWhen I don't even know who you are\nSaying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car\nBut you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's\nI'm up in the A, you so, so lame\nAnd no one here even mentions your name\nIt must be the weed, it must be the E\nCause you be popping, heard you get it popping\n\nWhy you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know\nLying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows\nIt's clear that you're upset with me\nFinally found a girl that you couldn't impress\nLast man on the earth still couldn't get this\nYou're delusional, you're delusional\nBoy, you're losing your mind\nIt's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know\nWhy you wasting your time?\nGot you all fired up with your Napoleon complex\nSeeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nBoy, why you so obsessed with me?\n\n[Don't Forget About Us]\nDon't baby, don't baby, don't let it go\nNo baby, no baby, no baby, no\nDon't baby, don't baby, don't let it go\nMy baby boy\n\nJust let it die with no goodbyes\nDetails don't matter, we both paid the price\nTears in my eyes\nYou know sometimes it'd be like that baby\n\nNow every time I see you I pretend I'm fine\nWhen I want to reach out to you\nBut I turn and I walk and I let it ride\nBaby, I must confess\nWe were bigger than anything\nRemember us at our best\nAnd don't forget about\n\nLate nights, playing in the dark\nAnd waking up inside my arms\nBoy, you'll always be in my heart and\nI can see it in your eyes you still want it\nSo don't forget about us\nI'm just speaking from experience\nNothing can compare to your first true love\nSo I hope this will remind you\nWhen it's for real, it's forever\nSo don't forget about us\n\nAnd if she's got your head all messed up now\nThat's the trickery\nSo why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?\nI bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC\nBaby don't you, don't you forget about us\n\nLate nights, playing in the dark\nAnd waking up inside my arms\nBoy, you'll always be in my heart and\nI can see it in your eyes you still want it\nSo don't forget about us\nI'm just speaking from experience\nNothing can compare to your first true love\nSo I hope this will remind you\nWhen it's for real, it's forever\nSo don't forget about us\nLate nights, playing in the dark\nAnd waking up inside my arms\nBoy, you'll always be in my heart and\nI can see it in your eyes you still want it\nSo don't forget about us\nI'm just speaking from experience\nNothing can compare to your first true love\nSo I hope this will remind you\nWhen it's for real, it's forever\nSo don't forget about us", "image": "https://images.genius.com/65832e6df44aa891f7e1f7fbc71eab85.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mariah Carey"}
