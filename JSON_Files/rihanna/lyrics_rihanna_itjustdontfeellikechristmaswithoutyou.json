No\n\nVerse Two\nAnother tear, another regret boy\nThat your so far away\n\nCan't believe it was only last year\nWe shared that christmas day\nRemember when we took the sleigh ride\nRemember singing by the fire\nThere's not too muches in the day light\nI keep re-living you and I\n\n(Chorus)\nBreakdown:\nThe time we try to build a snow man\nThe time we tried to count the stars\nIt's crazy how we didn't know that\nThat we'd ever be apart\n\n(Chorus)\nNo, it just dont feel like xmas, without you...Oooh baby\nSee I try but I just didn't ride.
