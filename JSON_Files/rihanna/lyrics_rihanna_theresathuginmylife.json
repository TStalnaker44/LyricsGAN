(How am I gonna tell my mama?)\nShe's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)\nThere's a thug in my life\nAnd it's gonna cause crazy drama\nI'm gonna see him tonight\nI'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)\n\n[Outro: Rihanna]\nMama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (All of me)\nI won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8aa723800ce692e6193d5b1d4166a64d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
