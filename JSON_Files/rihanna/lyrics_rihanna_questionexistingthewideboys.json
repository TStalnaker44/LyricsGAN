(Yes)\nBut it taught me before a decision, ask this question first\n\n[Chorus]\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances of living, question existing\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances of living, question existing\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake off my cool\nShow them that under here, I'm just like you\nDo the mistakes I make\nMake me a fool or a human with flaws?\nAdmit that I'm lost, 'round of applause\nTake the abuse\nSometimes it feels like they want me to lose\nIt's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)\nBut the question that lingers, whether win or lose, is...\n\n[Chorus]\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances of living, question existing\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances of living, question existing\n\n[Bridge]\nDear Diary, it's Robyn\nEntertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am\nI'd like to think that I'm pretty normal\nI laugh, I get mad, I hurt\nI think guys suck sometimes\nBut when you're in the spotlight everything seems good\nOoh, yeah\nSometimes I feel like I have it worst\nCause I have to always keep my guard up\nI don't know who to trust\nI don't know who wants to date me for who I am\nOr who wants to be my friend for who I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances of living, question existing\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances of living, question existing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1dc8ed944d180aae0f231b864d271f2e.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
