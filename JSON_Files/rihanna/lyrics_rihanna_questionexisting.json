(Yes)\nBut it taught me\nBefore a decision, ask this question first\n\n[Chorus]\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances I'm given, question existing\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances I'm given, question existing\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake off my cool (Take off my cool)\nShow them that under here, I'm just like you\nDo the mistakes I've made make me a fool?\nOr a human with flaws?\nAdmit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)\nTake the abuse\nSometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)\nIt's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)\nBut the question that lingers whether win or lose, is\n\n[Chorus]\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances I'm given, question existing\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances I'm given, question existing\n\n[Spoken]\nDear Diary, it's Robyn\nEntertaining is something I do for a living\nThis is not who I am\nI'd like to think that I'm pretty normal\nI laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt\nI think guys suck sometimes\nBut when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good\nOoh, yeah\nSometimes I feel like I have it worst\n'Cause I have to always keep my guard up\nI don't know who to trust\nI don't know who wants to date me for who I am\nOr who wants to be my friend for who I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances I'm given, question existing\nWho am I living for?\nIs this my limit?\nCan I endure some more?\nChances I'm given, question existing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dabed3ab4ac63f01b11ce21e95e5c5db.1000x989x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
