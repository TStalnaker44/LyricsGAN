Who ya gonna run to?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou and me, we go back to jump rope in grade school\nMemories when you were trying too hard to play cool\nI don't mind, I know that you've gotta go to your changes\nTake your time, sometimes the heart rearranges\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAs long as we\u2019ve been together\nYou\u2019ve always been the one\nNobody knows you better\nWhen all is said and done\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip\nAnd you can't find your way back home\n(Can't find your way back home)\nWhen your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark\nAnd you know that you're all alone (You're all alone)\nWhen you just can't deal and you need something real\nSomeone who'll always come through\nWho ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)\nWho ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)\n\n[Bridge]\nThere ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)\nSo when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to\nLook over your shoulder, boy, and you know who'll be there\nYou know I'm gonna be right there, right there\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip\nAnd you can't find your way back home\nWhen your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark\nAnd you know that you're all alone\nWhen you just can't deal and you need something real\nSomeone who'll always come through\nWho ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?\nWhen there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in\nWho ya gonna run to?\nAnd you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothing\nWho ya gonna run to?\nWho ya gonna run to?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c436566c709dcca03120235054e5ad2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
