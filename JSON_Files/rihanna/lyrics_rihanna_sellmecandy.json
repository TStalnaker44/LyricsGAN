What\u2019s the cost?\n(I\u2019m the daddy) You the boss\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou could be a professional, boy, you make a sale\nI try to resist, but every time I fail\nThe one temptation that I gotta endure\nThe running through my body, now you\u2019re knocking at my door\nA thin little kiss and your call is really sweet\nBut the shawty that you\u2019re rocking is nothing like me\nYou\u2019re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore\nIt sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)\n\n[Chorus]\nTalk to me\nTake care of my dreams\nAll I need is you beside me\nIt\u2019s destiny, just let it be\nIf words can speak\nThen baby, sell it to me\nSell me candy, sell me love\nSell me heaven, sell me doves\nWhat\u2019s the charge? What\u2019s the cost?\n(I\u2019m the daddy) You the boss\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna play, more than you know\nSo don\u2019t you leave, and don\u2019t you go\nI want it all, until time falls\nHis arms, I want to roam\nI wanna love, give him my trust\nI wanna live, for both of us\nI wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder\nI wanna warm you when nights get colder\nI want love, love, love\nI want love, love, love\n\n[Chorus]\nTalk to me\nTake care of my dreams\nAll I need is you beside me\nIt\u2019s destiny, just let it be\nIf words can speak\nThen baby, sell it to me\nSell me candy, sell me love\nSell me heaven, sell me doves\nWhat\u2019s the charge? What\u2019s the cost?\n(I\u2019m the daddy) You the boss", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dabed3ab4ac63f01b11ce21e95e5c5db.1000x989x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
