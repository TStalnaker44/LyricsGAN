Oh-oh-oh-ohh\nWhat now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI found the one\nHe changed my life\nBut was it me that changed\nAnd he just happened to come at the right time\nI'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhatever it is\nIt feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror\nWhatever it is\nIt's just sitting there laughing at me\nAnd I just wanna scream\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat now?\nI just can't figure it out\nWhat now?\nI guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)\nWhat now? (Please tell me)\nWhat now?\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all\nBut the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone\n'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions\nI can't even get the emotions to come out\nDry as a bone, but I just wanna shout\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat now?\nI just can't figure it out\nWhat now?\nI guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)\nWhat now? (Somebody tell me)\nWhat now?\n\n[Outro]\nI don't know where to go\nI don't know what to feel\nI don't know how to cry\nI don't know, oh-oh, why\nI don't know where to go\nI don't know what to feel\nI don't know how to cry\nI don't know, oh-oh, why\nI don't know where to go\nI don't know what to feel\nI don't know how to cry\nI don't know, oh-oh, why\nSo what now?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/602160a71cfe91329c10407282c39965.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
