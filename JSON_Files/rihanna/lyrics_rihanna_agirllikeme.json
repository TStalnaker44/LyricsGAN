(If I asked him to)\nTo take all my dreams and to make them true\nShow me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me\nJust like me\n\n[Bridge]\nMirror Mirror, on the wall\nCatch me now before I fall\nI wish I may, I wish I might\nFind the answer here tonight\nMirror Mirror, on the wall\nCatch me now before I fall (Before I fall)\nI wish I may, I wish I might\nFind the answer here tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen the whole world's turning left\nIt's when I'm going right\nI need someone to let me be just who I am inside\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest\nAnd a girl like me\nNever gonna settle for second best\nCould it be a boy like you? (Could it be a boy like you?)\nThat would give me anything if I asked him to (If I asked him to)\nTo take all my dreams and to make them true\nShow me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me\nOhh, just like me\n\n[Outro]\nMirror Mirror, on the wall\nCatch me now before I fall\nI wish I may, I wish I might\nFind the answer here tonight\n'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4c912f7e65505195f3d580144b6690cc.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rihanna"}
