No\n\n[Chorus]\nI come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you\nI always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong\nWith only you, only you, with only you\nCan I move on, can I move on, can I move on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc5d46c3a0a1f49ea3b79dbd59b6e57b.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bruno Mars"}
