Baby, what happened?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've been through some changes\nLike we in different places\nAnd now you think that you can just do what you do\nWithout any consequences\nIt's not what you say but what you don't say\nIt's not what you do but what you don't do\nIt's not where we go but where we don't go\nIt's like I don't even know you anymore\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nAnd I don't recognize you no more\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nWhat happened to the man that you were before?\nWhoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou use to look me in my eye but now you just look away\nIf I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay\nOh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night\nI promise, it's going to be the last time\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've been through some changes\nLike we in different places\nAnd now you think that you can just do what you do\nWithout any consequences\nIt's not what you say but what you don't say\nIt's not what you do but what you don't do\nIt's not where we go but where we don't go\nIt's like I don't even know you anymore\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nAnd I don't recognize you no more\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nWhat happened to the man that you were before? whoa\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat you want me to do (do)\nI'm not gun' chase after you (you)\nTell me how can I get (get)\nBack the man I first met (met)\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's not what you say but what you don't say\nIt's not what you do but what you don't do\nIt's not where we go but where we don't go\nIt's like I don't even know you anymore\nYou're just a stranger (don't know you no more)\nA stranger and I don't recognize you no more\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nWhat happened to the man that you were before?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc5d46c3a0a1f49ea3b79dbd59b6e57b.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bruno Mars"}
