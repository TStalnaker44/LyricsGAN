Bruno Mars...\nC'mon!\n\nVerse 1 (J. Reyez):\nWhen I wake up next to you girl\nIt's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds\nYou're beautiful and you're always shining\nYour happiness to me is worth more than diamonds\nMany people are there, but you're worth keeping\nThe same letters, three words and one meaning\nI love you, but we have our little arguments\nThat don't stop untill we forgot who started it\nI blank out and the thoughts around in me\nYou and I, everytime you smiled at me\nAnd I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you\nYour eyes, the world I see in you\nAnd time never goes to waste\nDon't change, cuz you can never be replaced\nThis love, you can never rearrange\nEverytime when I see your face\n\nRefrain (Bruno Mars):\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\nCuz you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nAnd when you smile\nThe whole world stops and stares for a while\nCuz girl you're amazing\nJust the way you are\n\nVerse 2 (J. Reyez):\nJust the way you express with \"ing\" girl\nYou're nothing short of my everything\nAnd every memory so sentimental\nYour happiness is my essential\n\nThis a way for me to say thanks\nNo stress, I want you to give me strenght\nWhen I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect\nBut to the world you're just one person\nBut to that person you mean the world is just\nHow we ride, me and my girl, uhh\nWe do this Bonnie and Clyde shit\nWe fall together, we coincided\nThe way to my heart it was hard to find it\nBut you found dead deep down inside of this love\nYou can never rearrange\nEverytime when i see your face\n\nRefrain (Bruno Mars):\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\nCuz you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nAnd when you smile\nThe whole world stops and stares for a while\nCuz girl you're amazing\nJust the way you are\n\nThe way you are (x2)\nGirl you're amazing, just the way you are\n\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\nCuz you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nAnd when you smile\nThe whole world stops and stares for a while\nCuz girl you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nYeah-ahh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc5d46c3a0a1f49ea3b79dbd59b6e57b.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bruno Mars"}
