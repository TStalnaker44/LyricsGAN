Body is iconic\nNo way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile\nThe music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while\nYou see, music make her dance\nAnd money, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe's a super freak\nYou wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls\nNo, she don't go where preachers preach\nShe only go to the church where dollars fall\nWatch her drop it like, (dat..) hey!\n\nPre Chorus (Inno Thakid)\nThen she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it\nFacial, legendary. Body is iconic\nNo way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile\nThe music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while\nYou see, music make her dance\nAnd money, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nWatch her....\nGive her what you got, give her, give her what you got...\n\n(Inno Thakid)\nAs soon as I walked up in, I need some oxygen\nFirst thing I noticed is shorty's been doing squats again\nSo bring them boxes in, let them know wer're some bosses\nWe're tossing them dollars often, no tithing, it's just the offering\nShe don't be hot for them, don't even want to talk to them\nThey pull up in the parking lot, she spots them by their moccasins\nShe's on the clock again, her work ethic is wild\nThe music gets her to dance, but the money makes her smile\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while\nYou see, music make her dance\nAnd money, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc5d46c3a0a1f49ea3b79dbd59b6e57b.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bruno Mars"}
