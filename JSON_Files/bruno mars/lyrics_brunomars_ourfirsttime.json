Is that okay?\nGirl, no need to be nervous\nCause I got you all night\nDon't you worry about a thing, babe\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\n\n[Verse 2]\nClothes are not required\nFor what we got planned\nOoh, girl, you're my desire\nYour wish is my command\nTreat you like a princess\nOoh, girl, you're so delicious\nLike ice cream on a sunny day\nGonna eat you before you melt away\n\n[Chorus]\nIs that alright? Is that okay?\nGirl, no need to be nervous\nCause I got you all night\nDon't you worry about a thing, babe\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\n\n[Refrain]\nDon't it feel good, babe?\nDon't it feel good, baby?\nCause it's so brand new, babe\nIt's so brand new, baby\nDon't it feel good, babe?\nDon't it feel good, baby?\nCause it's so brand new, babe\nIt's so brand new, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5b83aa26deb6be8345adba77215734a5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bruno Mars"}
