Playa hatin'?\nIf this is how it's gonna be\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nSince you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)\nOh, look what you're making me do\n\n[Verse 2]\nHoney pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby\nSendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?\nOh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games\nI don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'\nAll the eesha's waitin' on me\nSo why you contemplatin'?

Sorry I can't get to the phone right now but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you\n\nDamn...\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm calling calling calling calling all my lovelies\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nOh, since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me, baby)\nLook what you're making me do\n\n[Outro]\nPick up the phone, pick up the phone\n'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/21a10d2c02741b9d9d62da8aa3d6de4f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bruno Mars"}
