I've been looking for her all night\n\nClub closing up, I'm still looking for you\nWalked up to the ladies room\nNo luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth\n\nNext thing I know\nShe tell my show, \"This ain't you\nLooking at you, you wanna take me home\nSo tonight, I just might put you on\"\n\nI'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl\nI'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl\nI'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl\nI'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl\n\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\n\nWhere did she go?
