(Oh-oh)\nAll I'm tryna say is don't change (Ooh)\nDon't change (Ooh)\n\n[Verse 2: Jonah Marais, All]\nIt's hard, it's hard\nWhen you're in the dark\nTryna see things clearly\nYeah, I felt how you're feelin'\nAll of the stress, pressure\nAll in pursuit of perfection\nWish you knew that imperfections\nMake you an exception\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson, Daniel Seavey]\nYou're in the mirror, but you're not seein' yourself (Not seeing yourself)\nJust seein' all the ways you could be someone else\nI know you feel sometimes like you're not good enough (Oh)\nYou're not the only one\n\n[Chorus: Zach Herron with Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]\nAll I'm tryna say is don't change\nEvery part of you is just right, don't change\nNot a single curve or one line\nSo why cover up your flaws\nWhen they make you who you are?
