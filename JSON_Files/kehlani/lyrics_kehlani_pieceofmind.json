So I think\u2014I think that can remain a mystery\nAnd I think that's okay for it to remain a mystery\nDoes that make sense?\n\n[Verse 1]\nTryna forget all of the messages\nTryna forget all of the stressin'\n'Cause damn it was (extra and\u2014)\nTryna forget all of the secondary\nFeelings I had, man, it was fuckin' scary\nTryna get back to all my old ways\nTryna get back to all the hobbies\nFrom my old days (gettin' back)\nTryna forget all the unnecessary\nThoughts from my head, man, it was pretty scary\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAt least I learned a thing or two about me and you\nWhat we went through, it made me who I am (I am, I am)\nI can feel again, won't be numb again (numb)\nAt least I didn't mess it up, that was all your touch\nI don't miss it much, but it made me who I am (I am, I am)\nI can feel again, won't be dumb again (dumb)\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid I'm tryna break off a piece of mind\nA piece of mind that I can't get right\n(Can't get it right)\nSaid I'm tryna break off a piece of mind\nA piece of mind, my heart's on my side\n(Heart is on my side)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou said yourself, you made me who I am\nYou told me that after you, I would never love again (Didn't I?)\nOh you made sure that I would lose myself\nSo I wouldn\u2019t see, I needed no one else\nYou tell me that I was worth a million smiles\nAnd tell me that I was worth a million miles\nAnd tryna make sure that I forget the times that\nYou made me think that I just couldn't shine, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAt least I learned a thing or two about me and  you\nWhat we went through, it made me who I am (I am, I am)\nI can feel again, won't be numb again (numb)\nAt least I didn't mess it up, that was all your touch\nI don't miss it much but it made me who I am (I am, I am)\nI can feel again, won't be dumb again (dumb)\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid I'm tryna break off a piece of mind\nA piece of mind that I can't get right\n(I can't get it right)\nSaid I'm tryna break off a piece of mind\nA piece of mind, my heart's on my side\n(My heart is on my side)\n\n[Bridge]\nOn my side, yeah\nOn my side, yeah\nGotta get a little piece of mind\nGotta make sure that it feels just right\nGotta make sure that I\u2019ll make it last this time\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid I'm tryna break off a piece of mind\n(I'm tryna break off)\nA piece of mind that I can't get right\n(Mind that I can't get)\nSaid I'm tryna break off a piece of mind\n(A piece of my mind)\nA piece of mind, my heart's on my side\n(My heart\u2019s on my side)\n(My heart's on my side\u2014yeah, yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c5de64c62ec4a0b21b1f2f9767896db5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kehlani"}
