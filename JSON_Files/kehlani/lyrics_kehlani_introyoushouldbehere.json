Where are you?\nKehlani: I'm in the studio\nGrandpa: You're in the studio... New York? Studio LA? Studio Atlanta? Studio here?\nKehlani: Studio in LA\nGrandpa: In LA? Princess when do I get to see you? You know you are my granddaughter. You are like my daughter. Come on now\nKehlani: I know\nGrandpa: Don't [?] out to the curb. I know you're the star on top of stars and everybody every day has to remind me. Do you know who Kehlani is? Do you know who your granddaughter is? I know who she is and I know who she was\n\nThey say God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And as much as anyone can say how invincible I seem or how fearless I am or how brave I must be, I'm still human. And I've seen things and I've felt more pain than some will in their entire lives, all before the age of even being able to buy a fucking drink at a bar. But I have to be strong, not for myself but for a greater purpose, because I feel like my duty is far beyond me, you know? Beyond saving my family. It's for the world because somebody out there really needs to hear this. So to anybody who isn't here to see how far I've gone or how far I've yet to go. To family members that didn't make it or friends I lost along the way. Or maybe someone I gave my heart to that didn't know what to do with it. You should be here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d300162685cc76ddf503a0a328205a9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kehlani"}
