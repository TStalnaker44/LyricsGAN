Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nDid I? Did I?\nWaste my time, tryna keep it all running\nWaste my time, tryna keep it all running\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nDid I? Did I?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou used to living through all the screens\nYou used to wearing designer things\nYou don't know nothing 'bout working your way from the bottom and earning every ring\nYou think we competing for rings, you think you playing in my league\nBut you couldn't catch up if I took a break and vacationed for weeks on top of weeks\nCause I'm up right now, been up\nI'll come down when I'm not so high\nAnd life's not so loud\nCause I been hard, I write every word and they been bars\nTake every title, they been ours\nPull up lowkey cause we been stars, been stars\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nYou can tell me you ain't mean it\nYou can tell me it's deceiving\nThat you said it for no reason\nBut you seeming like you tryna get asked\n\n[Hook]\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nDid I? Did I?\nWaste my time, tryna keep it all running\nWaste my time, tryna keep it all running\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nDid I? Did I?\n\n[Bridge]\nYou can't fake it\nYou can't fake it\nYou can't fake it\nWhat is real is recognizing\nWe don't recognize you\nYou can't take it\nYou can't take it\nYou can't take it\nIt's too real for you to handle\nSo I got one more question\n\n[Hook]\nDid I?\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nDid I?\nHurt your feelings\nWaste my time, tryna keep it all running\nWaste my time, tryna keep it all running (Did I waste my time? Did I waste my time?)\nDid I? Did I?\nHurt your feelings when I hustled like that\nHurt your feelings when I stunted like that\nDid I? Did I?\n\n[Outro]\nDid I miss out on you?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3e15193018f431ceca75cbf40e880605.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kehlani"}
