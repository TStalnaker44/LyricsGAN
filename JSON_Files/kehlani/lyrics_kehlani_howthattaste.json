Tell me, how's the view now?\nBein' low, yeah you a snake\nYou puttin' on a show, that Ricki Lake\nHey man I don't trip, my life's great\nBut swallow that pride, tell me how that shit taste\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me how shit taste\nTell me how that shit taste\nTell me how that shit taste\nBitch tell me how that\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nAlways crowdin' it cause they solvin' me\nIn the mall goin' up cause they go hard for me\nYeah the only way is up, y'all gon' ball with me\nMan the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me\nTouch the sky with me, touch the sky with me\nMan the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me\nTouch the sky with me, touch the sky with me\nMan the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey askin' for the verse, a hundred racks\nIf you ain't talkin' money, then run it back\nMy pockets too deep for 'em not to be stacked\nYeah you lookin' like distraction, now fall back\nBitch your music's been weak, your fashion wack\nWas talkin' out your neck, not even facts\nI'm way too real to stoop low\nI'm too busy on the road, I'm too busy bookin' shows\nYeah you know how that shit taste\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me how shit taste\nTell me how that shit taste\nTell me how that shit taste\nBitch tell me how that\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nAlways crowdin' it cause they solvin' me\nIn the mall goin' up cause they go hard for me\nYeah the only way is up, y'all gon' ball with me\nMan the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me\nTouch the sky with me, touch the sky with me\nMan the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me\nTouch the sky with me, touch the sky with me\nMan the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/16c36862dece952731b8959eb0fbaf00.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kehlani"}
