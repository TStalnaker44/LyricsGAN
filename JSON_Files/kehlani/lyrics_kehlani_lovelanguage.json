Should we do it in the dark?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's all foreign to me, I don't speak what you speak\nI'll commit to learnin' if you, if you\nYou're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs\nPlease be patient with me, with you\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid I wanna be fluent in your love language\nLearnin' your love language\nI know I don't speak your language\nBut I wanna know more, baby\nFluent in your love language\nLearnin' your love language\nI know I don't speak your language\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever wanna get lost in translation\nNever wanna be on two separate pages\nSwear to me that you'll state facts\nIf you can take back, know I can take that\nI been workin' at it, hoping that you'd notice\nI been waitin', I just needed you to focus\nSwear to me that you'll show me\nNeed you to coach me, then we can proceed\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd still, it's all foreign to me, I don't speak what you speak\nI'll commit to learnin' if you, if you\nYou're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs\nPlease be patient with me, with you\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid I wanna be fluent in your love language (Your love)\nLearnin' your love language (Oh)\nI know I don't speak your language (No)\nBut I wanna know more, baby\nFluent in your love language (Love)\nLearnin' your love language (Love)\nI know I don't speak your language (No)\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid I wanna be fluent in your love language\nLearnin' your love language\nI know I don't speak your language\nBut I wanna know more, baby\nFluent in your love language (Love)\nLearnin' your love language (Love)\nI know I don't speak your language (No)\nBut I wanna know more, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa8ef45aae9a194d7b90d202d213e6f5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kehlani"}
