Helicopter in the sky\n'Cause we turn it up high in the speaker\n\n[Interlude]\nIf you know what it takes to be my man\nWe can go make love together\nYou can be my fuck tonight\nWe can tear it up tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna go downtown where my posse's at\nBecause I got nine lives like a kitty cat\nYou wanna roll, that's how I roll\nI wanna go bling-bling when I hear that bass\nI'm gonna do my thing if you wanna taste\nYou better know, that's how I roll\n\n[Bridge]\nShimmy, shimmy oh\nShimmy oh, shimmy hey\nWe can give 'em what they want and we can take it away\nTry our luck tonight, we can tear it up tonight\nIf you know what it takes to be my man\nWe can go make love together\nYou can be my fuck tonight, we can tear it up tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna go downtown where my posse's at\nBecause I got nine lives like a kitty cat\nYou wanna roll, that's how I roll\nI wanna go bling-bling when I hear that bass\nI'm gonna do my thing if you wanna taste\nYou better know, that's how I roll", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a34abf496e53ab602aa2070585b9b90d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
