You gotta let me know\nOh, baby, so I can let you go\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can hear your voice\nThe ring of yesterday\nIt seems so close to me\nBut yet so far away\nI should let it out\nTo save what's left of me\nAnd close the doors of doubt\nRevive my dignity, but\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI can't go on as long as I believe (As long as I believe)\nCan't let go when I keep wondering\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now, what have you found?\nWhere is your heart when I'm not around?\nWhere are you now? You gotta let me know\nOh, baby, so I can let you go\n\n[Bridge]\nI should let it out, it's time to let you go\nOh, baby, I just wanna know\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now, what have you found?\nWhere is your heart when I'm not around?\nWhere are you now? You gotta let me know\nOh, baby, so I can let you go\nWhere are you now, what have you found?\nWhere is your heart when I'm not around?\nWhere are you now? You gotta let me know\nOh, baby, so I can let you go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11784f95e44b707a5e5aa90d56e0cd58.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
