I like this\nI want you alright\nDo you want to touch me?\nI like this\nCan you handle this?\nI like this\nWe're going to slow it down\nJust a little bit\nI'm lying in bed, touching my skin\nI just can't take it baby\nOpen your eyes, whisper to me\nDo it again, do it again\n\n[Chorus]\nBad girls, and bad little boys\nWon't last forever\nBut good girls and good little boys\nWill make love together\nBad girls, and bad little boys\nWon't last forever\nBut good girls and good little boys\nWill make love together\nLove together, love together\nLove together, love together\nLove together\n\n[Outro]\nThat's good, do you like this?\nYeah, going to slow it down\nWe'll make love together", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7f4a9422772edba4fea23e66f67852ac.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
