(That's stupid)\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing\nI know the music's good (did you get that?)\nIf we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing\nI know that we'll be good\n\n[Bridge]\nMy chakra's all been green and red\nBut he wants blue and green instead... (let's just do it over)\nMy chakra's all been green and red\nBut he wants blue and green instead...\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing\nI know the music's good\nIf we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing\nI know that we'll be good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/48bf5f6e1180dd0e5ac3f327a6b4e97a.480x480x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
