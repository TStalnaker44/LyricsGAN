Yeah\nDon't you know?\nDon't you know?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou've got it all over him\nYou got me over him\nHoney, it's true\nThere's just you\nYou must have been Heaven sent\nHearing me call\nYou were out on a limb (Out on a limb)\nAnd you're all that he's not (All that he's not)\nJust look what I've got (Look what I've got)\n'Cause you've got it all (You've got it all)\nOver him\nYou've got it all over him\nYou got me over him\nHoney, it's true (so true)\nThere's just you\nYou must have been Heaven sent\nHearing me call\nYou were out on a limb (Out on a limb)\nAnd you're all that he's not (All that he's not)\nJust look what I've got (Look what I've got)\n'Cause you've got it all (You've got it all)\nOver him\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll over\nYou've got it all over\nAll over\nYou've got it all over him", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11784f95e44b707a5e5aa90d56e0cd58.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
