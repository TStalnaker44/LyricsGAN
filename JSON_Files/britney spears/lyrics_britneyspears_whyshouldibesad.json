Heaven knows\nFrom the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)\nWhy should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?\nJust take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's time for me to move along (Goodbye)\nIt's time for me to get it on (Okay)\nI'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)\nIt's time for me (Britney, let's go)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI sent you to Vegas with a pocket full of paper\nAnd with no ultimatums on you\nI thought \"What could separate us?\"\nBut it just seemed that Vegas only brought the player outta you\n(Hey baby, what's your name?) (You think?)\n\n[Verse 4]\nLavish homes and fancy cars, even got the drop Ferrari\nFilled up our garage for you\nMade your choice with all the teams, People and US Magazines\nTell me, who'd I do that for? Who?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy should I be sad? Heaven knows\nFrom the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)\nWhy should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?\nJust take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's time for me to move along (Goodbye)\nIt's time for me to get it on (Okay)\nI'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)\nIt's time for me (Britney, let's go)\nIt's time for me to move along (Goodbye)\nIt's time for me to get it on (Okay)\nI'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)\nIt's time for me (Britney, let's go)\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd don't you worry about our angels\nAll the magazines trying to intervene, saying things in the gossip section\nThey'll get good guidance and be trained well\nDon't worry, I'll keep our little secret, but I ask this question\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy should I be sad? Heaven knows\nFrom the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)\nWhy should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?\nJust take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's time for me to move along (Goodbye)\nIt's time for me to get it on (Okay)\nI'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)\nIt's time for me (Britney, let's go)\nIt's time for me to move along (Goodbye)\nIt's time for me to get it on (Okay)\nI'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)\nIt's time for me (Britney, let's go)\nIt's time for me to move along (Goodbye)\nIt's time for me to get it on (Okay)\nI'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)\nIt's time for me (Britney, let's go)\nC'mon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8492215f28371edf6df667a21fa6cf9b.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
