Who do I wanna be today?\nIf you came for a show, which role should I take?\nFading to grey, so do we make a big mistake?\nTrue colors'll show, baby, just put me on display\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThink I've been here before\nI've turned some hearts into stone\nAnd I can't hide it no more\n\n[Chorus]\nMy love is a mood ring\nUp and down emotions, all these mood swings\nYou know how to read the touch of my skin\nNothing on my body but this mood ring\nYou change me, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI have no secrets\n'Cause there\u2019s a version of me that I dunno how to hide\nWhen you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs (Glow)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThink I've been here before\nI've turned some hearts into stone\nAnd I can't hide it no more\n\n[Chorus]\nMy love is a mood ring\nUp and down emotions, all these mood swings\nYou know how to read the touch of my skin\nNothing on my body but this mood ring\nYou change me, yeah\n(Nothing on my body, but this mood ring, this mood ring)\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm in the palm of your hand\nMy temperature is at your command by my demand\nAnd now I'm falling for you\nI turn to golden from blue\nAnd you do too, ah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThink I've been here before\nI've turned some hearts into stone\nAnd I can't hide it no more\n\n[Chorus]\nMy love is a mood ring\nUp and down emotions, all these mood swings\nYou know how to read the touch of my skin\nNothing on my body but this mood ring\nYou change me, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/00873e1698d1b9603ba6d6813e53cfdf.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
