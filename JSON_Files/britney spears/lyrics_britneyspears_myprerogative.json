(Tell me why)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\nThat's my prerogative\n(It's my prerogative)\nIt's the way that I wanna live\n(It's my prerogative)\nYou can\u2019t tell me what to do\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't get me wrong\nI'm really not souped\nEgo trips is not my thing\nAll these strange relationships really gets me down\nI see nothing wrong in spreading myself around\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's talking all this stuff about me\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\nThat's my prerogative\nEverybody's talking all this stuff about me\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\nThat's my prerogative\nIt's the way that I wanna live\n(It's my prerogative)\nYou can\u2019t tell me what to do\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy can't I live my life\nWithout all of the things\nThat people say?\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's talking all this stuff about me\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\nThey say I'm crazy\nEverybody's talking all this stuff about me\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)\n(They say I'm nasty)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\n(It's my prerogative)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/51cd6c7ed7fc626c91a5556ab7315fd6.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
