Does your mama live there?\nWe can hook up at the hotel\nHe's down so I told him, \"Let's go\"\nWhat happened next, guess what?\nYou don't wanna know\n\n[Chorus]\nI was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'\nJust walked in and it's early mornin'\nBump, bump till the break of dawn and\nIt don't stop till the early mornin'\nPassed out on the couch I'm yawning\nJust walked in and it's early mornin'\nBump, bump till the break of dawn and\nIt don't stop till the early mornin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, in love\nI went out with my girl Jen\nAnd we called up Gabe and his friends\nHe was talking bout hitting up show\nSo I said, what the hell\nLet's go\nGot up, got on the dance floor\nHooked up with a guy named Joe\nWhen the music was fast and slow\nBut what happened next, guess what?\nYou don't wanna know\n\n[Chorus]\nI was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'\nJust walked in and it's early mornin'\nBump, bump till the break of dawn and\nIt don't stop till the early mornin'\nPassed out on the couch I'm yawning\nJust walked in and it's early mornin'\nBump, bump till the break of dawn and\nIt don't stop till the early mornin'\n\n[Hook]\nCall all your boys\nCall all your girls\nCall all your friends\nLet's do it again\nLet's do it again\nYes, early mornin'\nYes, can't keep doing this\n\n[Breakdown]\nI'll light your fire\nYour one desire\nPull on me, baby\nAnd I'll take you higher\n(I wanna get with you)\nYou should try her\nSo come over here and let's go so\n\n[Chorus]\nI was shaking my ass in the streets till mornin'\nJust walked in and it's early mornin'\nBump, bump till the break of dawn and\nIt don't stop till the early mornin'\nPassed out on the couch, I'm yawning\nJust walked in and it's early mornin'\nBump, bump till the break of dawn and\nIt don't stop till the early mornin'\n\n[Hook]\nCall all your boys\nCall all your girls\nCall all your friends\nLet's do it again\nLet's do it again\n\n[Outro]\nStop till the early mornin'\nStop till the early mornin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a2ba45a1b289c72cd58e43911d873ec.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
