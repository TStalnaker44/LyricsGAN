Were you still in the bed?\nOr is a nightmare keeping you up instead?\nPoor baby, are you feeling guilty for what you did?\nIf you think you're hurting, you ain't seen nothing yet\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWas it really worth it?\nWas she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man?\nI hope you know that you can't come back\n'Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're gonna see me in your dreams tonight\nMy face is gonna haunt you all the time\nI promise that you gon' want me back\nWhen your world falls apart, like shattered glass\nGlass, glass, glass\n\n[Verse 2]\nAre you having trouble focusing throughout the day?\nDo you find yourself still calling my name?\nDo you wish you could rewind time and take it back?\nI bet you realize that she ain't half the woman I am\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWas it really worth it?\nWas she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man?\nI hope you know that you can't come back\n'Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're gonna see me in your dreams tonight\nMy face is gonna haunt you all the time\nI promise that you gon' want me back\nWhen your world falls apart, like shattered glass\nGlass, glass, glass, glass, glass, glass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/05fff2178ecead7244662ee043aefdb8.600x603x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Britney Spears"}
