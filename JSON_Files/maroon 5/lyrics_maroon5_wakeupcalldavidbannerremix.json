I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't think so\n\n[Verse 2: Adam Levine]\nWould have bled to make you happy\nYou didn't need to treat me that way\nAnd now you beat me at my own game\nAnd now I find you sleeping soundly\nAnd your lovers screaming loudly\nHear a sound and hit the ground\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf you needed love, well, then ask for love\nCould have given love, now I\u2019m taking love\nAnd it\u2019s not my fault 'cause you both deserve\nWhat's coming now so don\u2019t say a word\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't feel so bad\n\n[Verse 3: David Banner]\nI couldn't disrespect the crib, you brought a man where I live\nNow my pistol pointed, tryin' to leave led in his ribs\nWhat's in something that I did, what's it time I did the spin\nWhen I think about him, I think time you crack a rib\nCall a preacher at the corner, it all when wrong\nDavid Banner, Maroon 5\nThis is bigger then the song, dawg\nYeah! Uh!\n\n[Chorus]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't feel so bad\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nNo, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad\n\n[Outro]\nI don\u2019t feel so bad (Wake up call)\nI don\u2019t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)\nI don\u2019t feel so bad (Don\u2019t you care about me anymore?)\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don\u2019t feel so bad\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me?
