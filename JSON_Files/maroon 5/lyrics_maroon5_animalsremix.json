Cole]\nThis is pain, this is love, this is sent from above\nThis a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be\nYou can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie\nBut in time you gon' find you was meant for me\nYou a part of me and I'm a part of you\nI'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you\nOverdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine\nTell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through\nI need a fix like d-boys need bricks\nAnd plus whips to transport 'em\nJ. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em\nOne more time together\nI hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nBaby, I'm preying on you tonight\nHunt you down, eat you alive\nJust like animals, animals, like animals-mals\nMaybe you think that you can hide\nI can smell your scent from miles\nJust like animals, animals, like animals-mals\nBaby, I'm...\n\n[Outro: Adam Levine]\nDon't tell no lies, you can't deny\nThe beast inside\nNo girl don't lie, you can't deny\nThe beast inside\nJust like animals\nJust like animals", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/67d1d0ff17f8c67e61b0d2bc297d9690.620x620x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
