I got nothing to lose\nI'm a slave to the way that you move\nI'm an addict for all that you do\nYou're the only drug I wanna do, yeah\nI can tell that you're needing my love\nAnd all I want is to give it to ya\nAnd don't give up on the moment tonight\nYou'll regret it the rest of your life, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down\nForgive me, forgive me now\nWould it kill you to forgive me now?\nBut if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down\nForgive me, forgive me now\nWould it kill you to forgive me?\nThis is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love\nWould it kill you to forgive me?\n\n[Bridge]\nI still don't get it, 'cause if you don't know it yet\nYou'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy, yeah\n'Cause I know I lie, and it wouldn't kill you trying\nWon't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me\n'Til you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down\nForgive me, forgive me now\nWould it kill you to forgive me now?\nBut if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down\nForgive me, forgive me now\nWould it kill you to forgive me?\nThis is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love\nWould it kill you to forgive me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18b24af6449275789abb8e7a36e5e57d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
