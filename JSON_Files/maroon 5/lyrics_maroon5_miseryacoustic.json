Yeah\nWhy won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah\nWhy do you do what you do to me? Yeah\nWhy won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI am in misery\nThere ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)\nWhy won't you answer me?\nThe silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Background]\nGirl, you really got me bad\nYou really got me bad\nNow I'm gonna get you back\nI'm gonna get you back\n\n[Outro: Background]\nGirl, you really got me bad\nYou really got me bad\nNow I'm gonna get you back\nI'm gonna get you back\nGirl, you really got me bad\nYou really got me bad\nNow I'm gonna get you back\nI'm gonna get you back\nGirl, you really got me bad\nYou really got me bad\nNow I'm gonna get you back\nI'm gonna get you back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9f1491156376b3db8cbbd3971760f439.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
