I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't think so\n\n[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]\nWould have bled to make you happy\nYou didn't need to treat me that way\nAnd now you beat me at my own game\nAnd now I find you sleeping soundly\nAnd your lovers screaming loudly\nHear a sound and hit the ground\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & (Mary J. Blige)]\nIf you needed love (Needed love), well, then ask for love (Ask for love)\nCould have given love (Given love), now I\u2019m taking love (Taking love)\nAnd it\u2019s not my fault (Not my fault) 'cause you both deserve (Both deserve)\nWhat's coming now (Coming now) so don\u2019t say a word\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't feel so bad\nI don't feel so bad\nI don't feel so bad\n\n[Bridge: Adam Levine & (Mary J. Blige)]\nI'm so sorry, darling (Ooh-ooh)\nDid I do the wrong thing? (Do the wrong thing)\nOh, what was I thinking?\nIs his heart still beating?\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige, (Mary J. Blige)]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore? (Don't you care)\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall (Six foot tall)\nCame without a warning so I had to shoot him dead\n(Shoot him dead)\nHe won't come around here anymore (Come around here)\nCome around here? I don't feel so bad\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore? (Don't you care?)\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nNo, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad\n\n[Outro: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\n(Don't you care, don't you care?)\nDon\u2019t you care about me?
