I can\u2019t see\nYou destroyed me, I won\u2019t fall apart again\nI\u2019m not falling apart\nTake what you wanted\nI will be just fine\nYou will be better off alone at night\nWaiting and falling\nConstantly calling out your name\nWill it ever change?\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I can\u2019t walk, I can\u2019t talk anymore\nSince you walked out the door\nAnd now I\u2019m stuck living out that night again\nI\u2019m not falling apart\n\n[Bridge]\nI heard you say you needed me now\nWhat\u2019s the problem? I can\u2019t see\nYou destroyed me, I won\u2019t fall apart again\nI\u2019m not falling apart\n\n[Outro]\nOh, ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09e0236f46df0a0c2fa2f88ec09b5b20.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
