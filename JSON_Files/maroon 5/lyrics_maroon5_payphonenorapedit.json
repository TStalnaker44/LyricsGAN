Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\nIf happy ever after did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairytales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou turned your back on tomorrow\n'Cause you forgot yesterday\nI gave you my love to borrow\nBut you just gave it away\nYou can't expect me to be fine\nI don't expect you to care\nI know I said it before\nBut all of our bridges burned down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've wasted my nights\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time when we called it love\nBut even the sun sets in paradise\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm at a payphone, trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\nIf happy ever after's did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAnd all those fairytales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nNow, I'm at a payphone\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, yeah, yeah\nNow baby, don't hang up\nSo I can tell you what you need to know\nBaby, I'm begging you, just please don't go\nSo I can tell you what you need to know\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I'm at a payphone, trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\nIf happy ever after did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAnd all these fairytales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nNow, I'm at a payphone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52af76244f7392149389dfc653cd0ec1.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
