Paid my dues\nPlayin' in a rockin' band\nHey Mama! Look at me\nI'm on my way to the promise land\n\nI'm on the highway to hell\nHighway to hell\nI'm on the highway to hell\nHighway to hell\n\nDont stop me!\n\nI'm on the highway to hell!\nI'm on the highway to hell!\nI'm on the highway to hell!\nI'm on the highway to hell!\n\nAnd I'm goin down..all the way!\nI'm on the highway to hell..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52af76244f7392149389dfc653cd0ec1.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
