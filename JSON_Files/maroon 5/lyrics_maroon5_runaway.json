Did it send?\nOr did you just get on with your life?\nOh\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I'm taking time to think and\nI don't think it's fair for us to\nTurn around and say goodbye\nI have this feeling when I\nFinally find the words to say\nBut I can't tell you if you turn around\nAnd run away, run away\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat am I supposed to do with these clothes?\nIt's my twisted way of keeping you close\nI'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man\nDid you get my message? Did it send?\nOr do you get along on your own?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I'm taking time to think and\nI don't think it's fair for us to\nTurn around and say goodbye\nI have this feeling when I\nFinally find the words to say\nBut I can't tell you if you turn around\nAnd run away, run away\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd it breaks me down when I see your face\nYou look so different but you feel the same\nAnd I do not understand\nI cannot comprehend\nThe chills your body sends\nWhy did it have to end?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I'm taking time to think and\nI don't think it's fair for us to\nTurn around and say goodbye\nI have this feeling when I\nFinally find the words to say\nBut I can't tell you if you turn around\nAnd run away, run away\nOh, I'm taking time to think and\nI don't think it's fair for us to\nTurn around and say goodbye\nI have this feeling when I\nFinally find the words to say\nBut I can't tell you if you turn around\nAnd run away, run away\n\n[Outro]\nRunaway, runaway\nTurn around and\nRunaway, runaway\nRunaway, runaway\nBut I can't tell you if you\nRunaway, runaway\nTurn around and runaway", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0282d42982e0b5d380186569518c1ff8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
