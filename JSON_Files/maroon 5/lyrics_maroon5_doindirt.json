'Cause everybody's watching us now\nWe're putting on a show for the crowd\nSo turn it up, baby, make it loud\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey you, say that you're only havin' fun and then\nYou call me up at 3AM again\nBaby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt\nAnd now all that I got is just a microphone\nTo let you know that I am all alone\nI know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts\n\n[Chorus]\nHold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night\nYou're shining like a neon light\nI light you up when I get inside\nSo won't you touch me?
