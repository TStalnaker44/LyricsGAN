How could I?\nThese questions lead to goodbye\nBut now I got my freedom\nDon't I?\n\n[Chorus]\nI parked my car outside your house\nHope that someday you'll come home\nSeems the woman that I love\nIs someone that I hardly know\nAnd after all this time\nI finally found a way to be alone\nI'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nShy girl, so humble\nWith eyes that make me stumble\nSomehow not speaking lets me know everything\nI go out, You eat in\nHot from the situation\nYou're naked in daylight\nWrap yourself up and goodnight\nI'm burning, I'm hungry\nAngry \u2018cause she don't love me\nYou got me completely\nIn my own game you beat me\n\n[Chorus]\nI parked my car outside your house\nHope that someday you'll come home\nSeems the woman that I love\nIs someone that I hardly know\nAnd after all this time\nI finally found a way to be alone\nI'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind\n\n[Bridge]\nI will be back again\nNo this is not the end\nI've fallen hard this time but I not giving in\nI want the world to know that I won't let you forget\nThe tears that you shed\nI'll make it impossible to let go\n\n[Chorus]\nI parked my car outside your house\nHope that someday you'll come home\nSeems the woman that I love\nIs someone that I hardly know\nAnd after all this time\nI finally found a way to be alone\nI'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind\nI parked my car outside your house\nHope that someday you'll come home\nSeems the woman that I love\nIs someone that I hardly know\nAnd after all this time\nI finally found a way to be alone\nI'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09e0236f46df0a0c2fa2f88ec09b5b20.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
