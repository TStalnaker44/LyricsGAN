I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't think so\n\n[Verse 2]\nWould have bled to make you happy\nYou didn't need to treat me that way\nAnd now you beat me at my own game\nAnd now I find you sleeping soundly\nAnd your lovers screaming loudly\nHear a sound and hit the ground\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you needed love, well, then ask for love\nCould have given love, now I\u2019m taking love\nAnd it\u2019s not my fault 'cause you both deserve\nWhat's coming now so don\u2019t say a word\n\n[Chorus]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't feel so bad\nI don't feel so bad\nI don't feel so bad\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm so sorry, darling\nDid I do the wrong thing?\nOh, what was I thinking?\nIs his heart still beating?\n\n[Chorus]\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nCome around here? I don't feel so bad\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don't think so\nSix foot tall\nCame without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead\nHe won't come around here anymore\nNo, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad\n\n[Outro]\nI don\u2019t feel so bad (Wake up call)\nI don\u2019t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)\nI don\u2019t feel so bad (Don\u2019t you care about me anymore?)\nDon\u2019t you care about me? I don\u2019t feel so bad\nWake up call\nCaught you in the morning with another one in my bed\nDon't you care about me anymore?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59d0847aafbc28fa25811f469de9be73.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
