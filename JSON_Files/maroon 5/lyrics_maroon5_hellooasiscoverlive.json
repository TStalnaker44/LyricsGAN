Says it's good to be back, good to be back!\nHello!\nHello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!\nHello!\nHello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!\n\nHello!\nHello!\nHello!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52af76244f7392149389dfc653cd0ec1.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
