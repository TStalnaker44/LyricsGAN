(hiding)\nShe's on the outside\nI'm on the inside crying (crying)\nJust another crazy boy\nHungry for your\n\n[Chorus]\nHot love\nWrap yourself around me like a warm glove\nThe emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up\nNever need to go back to the way I was\nThe way I was\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried and tried and tried and tried\nBut I have no concept of consequence\nAnd I'm a master of self defense\nDays get longer\nLife gets shorter\nShe rips me like no other\nSo oh dripping from head to toe\nWhere are you hiding (hiding)\nShe's on the outside\nI'm on the inside crying (crying)\n\n[Chorus]\nHot love\nWrap yourself around me like a warm glove\nThe emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up\nNever need to go back to the way I was\nThe way I was\nThe way I was\nHot love\nWrap yourself around me like a warm glove\nThe emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up\nNever need to go back to the way I was\nThe way I was\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can't make the same mistake\nIf you lose my love\nIt was yours to take\nBreak down your door\nTake a little more\nWhen I need you around\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd I'm so terrified of leaving\nIt's a new low\nTry and pick me up again but\nLet go see how far I get without you\nDesperately need more of your\n\n[Chorus]\nHot love\nWrap yourself around me like a warm glove\nThe emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up\nNever need to go back to the way I was\nThe way I was\nHot love\nWrap yourself around me like a warm glove\nThe emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up\nNever need to go back to the way I was\nThe way I was", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09e0236f46df0a0c2fa2f88ec09b5b20.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
