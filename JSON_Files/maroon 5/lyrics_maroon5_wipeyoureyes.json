How could we could forget\nWhy did we let the pressure get into our heads?\nYour broken heart requires all of my attention\n'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you\n\n[Chorus]\nHey you, come over and let me embrace you\nI know that I'm causing you pain too\nBut remember if you need to cry\nI'm here to wipe your eyes\nTonight, before you fall asleep\nI run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)\nCry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes\nI know I made you feel this way\nYou gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)\nCry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes\n\n[Bridge]\nPlease don't loose your faith\nDon't worry cause I'm here to keep you safe\nI promise if you let me see your face\nThat I won't let you down, I won't let you down\n\n[Break]\nI'm here to wipe your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nTonight, before you fall asleep\nI run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)\nCry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes\nI know I made you feel this way\nYou gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)\nCry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/015448860dccbf367364e899f97c0948.300x300x1.png"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
