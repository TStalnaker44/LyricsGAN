Gotta make a decision\n'Cause I been fizzing off the top, like a soda been shook\nAnd I been pennin' down my thoughts, till I'm out of the books\nUsed to talk about the thots, ain't give 'em a look now\nListen to my hook now-\n\nCold enough to-\nChill my bones\nIt feels like I don't-\nKnow you anymore\nI don't understand why you're so-", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52af76244f7392149389dfc653cd0ec1.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
