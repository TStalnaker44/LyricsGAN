Are you giving up?\nWhen you know, you know, you know\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you\nSo you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me\nAll night putting your whisper on me\nGiving that love and emotion that I know\nDoesn't really matter what you do, I'll be back for you\nComing back for you, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know there are millions of miles in between our hearts\nBut I will come running for you; I don't care how far\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you close your eyes, do you see me, love?\nAm I keeping you awake?\nWhat you scared about? Are you giving up?\nWhen you know, you know, you know\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you\nSo you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me\nAll night putting your whisper on me\nGiving that love and emotion that I know\nDoesn't really matter what you do, I'll be back for you\nComing back for you, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl\nI'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry now, now\nDon't you worry now\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl\nYou know that I'm coming back for you\nDon't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you\nSo you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me\nAll night putting your whisper on me\nGiving that love and emotion that I know\nDoesn't really matter what you do, I'll be back for you\nComing back for you, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18b24af6449275789abb8e7a36e5e57d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Maroon 5"}
