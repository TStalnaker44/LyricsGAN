Don't go all coy\nDon't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault\nSee I can see that look in your eyes\nThe one that shoots me each and every time\n\n[Chorus]\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days when I see you\nYou make it look like I'm see-through\nDo tell me why you waste our time\nWhen your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied\nYou know I know just how you feel\nI'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when\n\n[Chorus]\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\n\n[Bridge]\nTime and time again, I play the role of fool\n(Just for you)\nAnd even in the daylight when your gaming\n(I don't see through)\nI try to look for things I hear but my eyes never find\nThough I do know how you play\n\n[Chorus]\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b8d001741aeb9bf6a5514fa24e1ba60.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Adele"}
