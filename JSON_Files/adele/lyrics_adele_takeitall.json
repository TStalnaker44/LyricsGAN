Tried my best\nGave you everything I had, everything and no less\nDidn't I do it right? Did I let you down?\nMaybe you got too used to, well having me around\nStill how can you walk away from all my tears?\nIts gonna be an empty road without me right here\n\n[Chorus]\nBut go on and take it\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back at this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe I should leave to help you see\nNothing gets better than this\nAnd this is everything we need\nSo is it over? Is this really it?\nYou're giving up so easily\nI thought you loved me more than this\n\n[Chorus]\nBut go on, go on and take it\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back at this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\n\n[Bridge]\nI will change if I must\nSlow it down and bring it home, I will adjust\nOh if only, if only you knew\nEverything I do is for you\n\n[Chorus]\nBut go on, go on and take it\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back at this crumbling fool\nJust take it\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back at this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\nTake it all with my love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b72029e91a73dbe50e6a063e83f0801c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Adele"}
