I've been here for days\nWho's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?\nI know they'll be coming to find me soon\nBut I fear I'm getting used to being held by you\n\n[Chorus: All]\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, look what you've done now\nBaby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, you got me tied down\nBaby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way\n\n[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]\nWho's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes?\nUsed to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind\nI know they'll be coming to find me soon\nBut my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room\nYeah, I fell for you\n\n[Chorus: All]\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, look what you've done now\nBaby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, you got me tied down\nBaby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way\n\n[Bridge: Liam & Harry]\nAll my life I've been on my own\nI used the light to guide me home\nBut now together we're alone\nAnd there's no other place I'd ever wanna go\nBaby, look what you've done\n\n[Chorus: All]\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, look what you've done now\nBaby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, you got me tied down\nBaby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way\n\n[Outro: All]\nBaby, look what you've done\nBaby, look what you've done to me\nBaby, look what you've done to me", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/6f76a70e6e9daaefc20c5bd1b52fed4e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
