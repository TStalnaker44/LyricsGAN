Whoa\nDoes he know you're out, and I want you so bad? Oh\nTonight you're mine, baby\nDoes he know that you'll never go back? Oh\nDoes he know?\n\n[Verse 2: Liam Payne]\nI catch your eye then you turn away\nBut there's no hiding the smile on your face\nInside and out, baby, head to toe\nHe's not around, girl, you let me know\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan]\nYour secret tattoo, the way you change moods\nThe songs that you sing when you're all alone\nHe knows how you dance in front of your friends\nBut, baby, baby\n\n[Chorus: Zayn Malik]\nDoes he know you can move it like that? Whoa\nDoes he know you're out, and I want you so bad? Oh\nTonight, you're mine, baby\nDoes he know that you'll never go back? Oh\nDoes he know?\n\n[Bridge: Louis Tomlinson & Liam Payne]\nHe'll never know the way you lie when you look at me\nSo keep trying, but you know I see\nAll the little things that make you who you are\nSo tell me, girl\nDoes he know you can move it like that?\nDoes he know that you'll never go back? Woah\n\n[Chorus: Zayn Malik]\nDoes he know you can move it like that? Whoa\nDoes he know you're out, and I want you so bad? Oh\nTonight, you're mine, baby\nDoes he know that you'll never go back?
