That\u2019s what it\u2019s about... Where\u2019s the lighter? Can anybody pass me a lighter please? I want to light up. You got a lighter?\n\nAfter much searching, Louis can be seen lighting up and heard coughing\n\nLouis: So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days... What do you think Zayn? About that kind of content?\n\nZayn: I think it\u2019s very controversial\n\nLouis sees a police motorbike rider escorting their convoy\n\nLouis: \u2018That\u2019s the police. That\u2019s the po po... Nice. I\u2019m trying to blow it into the camera. Smokescreen baby!... That\u2019s just Zayn warming up there before the show. Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two-hour intense warm up regime before every show, just to get himself in the zone. One very, very important factor to Zayn\u2019s warm up, of course is Mary Jane herself. In fact I\u2019m presenting it to him now for some fantastic singing\n\nLouis passes Zayn the roll up cigarette\n\nLouis: How is it Zayn?\n\nZayn: Nice\n\nLouis: That\u2019s the po po. One nil\n\nLouis starts filming out the window\n\nLouis: Get a bit of the culture. How\u2019s that kind of culture?\n\nZayn: It\u2019s great culture this. It\u2019s going to be even greater culture when we get to Jamaica\n\nMember of crew: I just got an update. We got chicken in Chile\n\nZayn: Chicken in Chile! Chile chicken\n\nLouis: Yeh baby. That\u2019s the po po. Two nil\n\nLouis puts on an exaggerated dopey voice and sways the camera around:\n\nLouis: Fucking \u2018ell bro, I\u2019m chillin. Oh my God bro. My \u2018ed\u2019s a wreck\n\nLouis: It\u2019s green only! Nig!\n\nLouis: I\u2019m just wondering now. I\u2019m sitting here in Peru wondering will this come back to me? Who knows? Maybe, maybe not\n\nAnother police bike passes:\n\nLouis: One nil bitch! Look at this bitch... He\u2019s having a look. He\u2019s thinking. I\u2019m sure I can smell an illegal substance in there. And he\u2019s hit the nail on the head\n\nZayn: Carl showed... me Kid Rock\u2019s last book. And it\u2019s about twice the size. Hard back. Black. Simple writing. No bullshit.No like \u2018My favourite colour\u2019s blue.. And all just sick pictures\n\nLouis is passed the roll up by a crew member and zooms in on it:\n\nLouis: Ooo Stubbsy!\n\nZayn: \u201cEvery time you look in it you just think 'fuck I\u2019ve never seen that picture.' That\u2019s a bad photo...instead of boring crap.\n\nLouis: \u201cYeah I know, same old crap that I\u2019m sure the fans are bored of reading.\u201d\n\nZayn: \"They want to know what we're up to now man.\"\n\nTalking about the Kid Rock book Zayn says: \u201cHe\u2019s smoking a J in one of the pictures Louis and he\u2019s got a gold ring on his middle finger, which is a bid weird, but, aside from that he\u2019s sticking his middle finger up with a J in his mouth, and that's one of the pictures in the book.\n\nLouis: \u201cSick.\u201d", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e08cc1a9a96cb263a1b98aea2a3bfcc0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
