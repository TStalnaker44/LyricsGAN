(So late)\nI can't let her get away from me, oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3: Zayn Malik]\nWhen I say that I can't do it no more\nShe's back in my door\n\n[Final Chorus: Zayn Malik]\nShe's not afraid\nShe's not afraid of all the attention\nShe's not afraid of running wild (running wild)\nHow come she's so afraid of falling in love? (Falling in love)\nShe's not afraid of scary movies (she's not afraid)\nShe likes the way we kiss in the dark (kiss in the dark)\nBut she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love\n\n[Outro: Zayn Malik]\nShe's not afraid\nShe's not afraid", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f6290727688efe6e612b9b87f337cfdd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
