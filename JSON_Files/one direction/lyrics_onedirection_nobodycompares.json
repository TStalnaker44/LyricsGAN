Yeah, girl if I blew it\nJust tell me what I did, let's work through it\nThere's gotta be some way\nTo get you to want me like before\n\n[Chorus: All & Harry]\n'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress\nAnd it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight\nNo one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile\nBaby tell me how to make it rightNow all my friends say it's not really worth it\nBut even if that's trueNo one in the world could stop me from not moving on\nBaby even if I wanted to\nNobody compares to you\n\n[Verse 2: Louis]\nWe're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed\nI remember the taste of your lipstick\nNow you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart\nYou're tearing up my heart\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Harry]\nDid I do something stupid?
