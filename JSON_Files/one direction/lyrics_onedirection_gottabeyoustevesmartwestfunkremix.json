One more, one more time, I'll make it better\nOne more, one more, can we try? One more, one more\nCan we try one more time to make it all better?\nCan we try one more, one more, can we try? One more, one more\nCan we try one more, one more, can we try? One more, one more\nCan we try one more, one more, can we try? One more, one more\nCan we try one more time to make it all better?\n\n[Chorus: Harry & All]\nIt's gotta be you\nIt's gotta be you, only you, only you\nIt's gotta be you, only you\nIt's gotta be you, oh, only you\nIt's gotta be you\nIt's gotta be you, only you, only you\nIt's gotta be you, only you\nIt's gotta be you, oh, only you\n\n[End: Zayn]\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby\nOne more time, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7279756c5e5e6c06301a77392dc54b76.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
