Is it so wrong?\nThat you make me strong?\n\n[Verse 2: Louis]\nThink of how much love that's been wasted\nPeople always trying to escape it\nMove on to stop their heart breaking\nBut there's nothing I'm running from\nYou make me strong\n\n[Chorus: All]\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong? Is it so wrong?\n\n[Bridge: Zayn & Niall]\nSo, baby, hold on to my heart, yeah\nNeed you to keep me from falling apart\nI'll always hold on\n'Cause you make me strong\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong? Is it so wrong?\n\n[Chorus: All & Harry]\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong? Is it so wrong?\nThat you make me strong?\nI'm sorry if I say, \"I need you\"\nBut I don't care, I'm not scared of love\n'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker\nIs that so wrong? Is it so wrong\nThat you make me strong?", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/b438de0c51de11f3f579ac3524560d1d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
