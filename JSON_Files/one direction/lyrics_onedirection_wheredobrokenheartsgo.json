Where do broken hearts go?\n\n[Verse 2: Liam & Harry & All]\nYeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue\nIs at the top of the list of the things I want\nMind is running in circles of you and me\nAnyone in between is the enemy\nShadows come with the pain that you're running from\nLove was something you never heard enough\nYeah, it took me some time but I figured out\nHow to fix up a heart that I let down\n\n[Chorus: Zayn & Harry & All]\nNow I'm searching every lonely place\nEvery corner calling out your name\nTryna find you but I just don't know\nWhere do broken hearts go?\nAre you sleeping baby by yourself\nOr are you giving it to someone else?\nTryna find you but I just don't know\nWhere do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?\n\n[Bridge: Harry & All]\nTell me now, tell me now\nTell me where you go when you feel afraid\n(Where do broken hearts go?)\nTell me now, tell me now\nTell me, will you ever love me again, love me again?\n\n[Chorus: Zayn & All & Louis & (Harry)]\nNow I'm searching every lonely place\nEvery corner calling out your name\nTryna find you but I just don't know\nWhere do broken hearts go?\nAre you sleeping baby by yourself\nOr are you giving it to someone else?\nTryna find you but I just don't know\nWhere do broken hearts go? Tell me where you're hiding out\nWhere do broken hearts go?\n(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)\nWhere do broken hearts go? Tell me 'cause I'm 10 feet down\nWhere do broken hearts go? Come on baby, come and get me out\nCome on baby, come and get me out\n(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)\nWhere do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?Where do broken hearts go?
