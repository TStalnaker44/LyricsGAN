Vas Happening boys?\nThey lived with Zayn and their room was vile\nVas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys?\n\nDid you know Harry's such a slob?\nHe needs to win X Factor cause he can't get a job\n\nAnd, oh, Louis needs a boat\nHe dresses like he owns one\nCause he's got no other clothes\nThey really need your vote\n\n[Chorus]\nVas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys?\n(Vas Happening boys?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMick Jagger could be Harry's dad\nVas Happening mum? Vas Happening Mick?\nWhen Liam sings he makes his face look sad\nVas Happening song? Vas Happening sad?\n\nAnd Zayn's the master of echoes (echo, echo, echo)\nAnd Niall was raised by leprechauns so he won't ever grow\n\nAnd, oh, Louis needs that boat\nHe dresses like he owns one\nAnd it's becoming a joke\nThey really need your vote\n\n[Chorus]\nVas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys?\nVas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys?\nVas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys?\n(Billy bob bob dilly)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e08cc1a9a96cb263a1b98aea2a3bfcc0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
