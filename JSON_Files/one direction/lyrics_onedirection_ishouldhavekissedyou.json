Is there somebody else on your mind?\nI'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?\nIs your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?\nI can't believe I let you walk away when, when I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\n\n[Verse 2: Liam, (Louis), & Zayn]\nEvery morning when I leave my house, I always look for you, yeah\nI see you every time I close my eyes, what am I gonna do?\n(And all my friends say)\nThat I'm punching over my weight\n(But in your eyes I)\nSaw how you were looking at me\n(It's all that I can think about,) oh\n(You're all that I can think about)\n\n[Chorus: All]\nIs your heart taken?  Is there somebody else on your mind?\nI'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?\nIs your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?\nI can't believe I let you walk away when, when I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\n\n[Bridge: Zayn & Liam]\nWhen you stood there, just a heartbeat away\nWhen we were dancing and you looked up at me\nIf I had known then that I'd be feeling this way\nIf I could replay, I would have never let you go\nNo, oh, never have let you go\nAm I out of time?\n\n[Chorus: All]\nIs your heart taken?  Is there somebody else on your mind?\nI'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?\nIs your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?\nI can't believe I let you walk away when, when I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you\nI should, I should oh, I should have kissed you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/461c0e80ed29ddae7fd9dfb3d8b03b66.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
