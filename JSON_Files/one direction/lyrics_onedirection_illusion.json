I'm not trying to mislead you\nI promise falling for me won't be a mistake\n\n[Chorus: All]\nNo baby, this is not an illusion\nI've really got my heart out on my sleeve\nOh baby, this is not an illusion\nThere's magic between you and me\nNo baby, this is not an illusion\nYou really got me lifted on my feet\nSo tell me you believe in love\n'Cause it's not an illusion to me\n\n[Bridge: Niall]\nYou can tie me up in chains, you can throw away the key\nBut there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave\nYou're the truth I can't explain, you're the only one I see\nIt's not an illusion to me\n\n[Chorus: All]\nNo baby, this is not an illusion\nI've really got my heart out on my sleeve\nOh baby, this is not an illusion\nThere's magic between you and me\nNo baby, this is not an illusion\nYou really got me lifted on my feet\nSo tell me you believe in love\n'Cause it's not an illusion to me\nSo tell me you believe in love\n'Cause it's not an illusion", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a0b3a06397b10e5ea6a00df56084b93d.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "One Direction"}
